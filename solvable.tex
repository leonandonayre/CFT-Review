\section{Introduction}

Sketch map of CFTs according to symmetry: deg. fields, no deg. fields, local conf. sym, global conf. sym.

CFTs that are exactly solvable with known methods = bootstrap, analytic and numerical. Only Virasoro. Do not characterize with twist gap, as symmetry cannot be inferred from spectrum: chiral symmetry fields might be absent from spectrum. Also, affine abelian symmetry can be present in spectrum but absent in interactions. (Is there a strong statement that unitary CFTs do not have these pathologies?)

Forget Coulomb gas, a dead end. For correl fct, applies only if we have two deg. fields? But used to find spectrum of $O(n)$ etc. Larger symmetry allows many generalizations, but tend to be always more complicated. (Liouville not solved from WZW, quite the opposite.) No modular bootstrap. 

Exact solution means analytic expression for 3-point structure constants. Here: CFTs that are presumed to be solvable, not necessarily solved. 

Focus on correl fct: no modular bootstrap, no KPZ. These methods are efficient at getting the spectrum but we can get it otherwise. 

This review: only necessary calculations. Derive the recursion for blocks? hard part is coef $R_{r,s}$ but it obeys simple shift equations. Rewrite it in terms of Upsilon functions, and somehow derive it from Liouville theory! But cancellation of double poles hard to argue? And need to determine sign, since we get square of $R_{r,s}$. We can choose any value of the continuous parameters including $c$, but is there a value that makes $R_{r,s}$ simple enough? And what about the $\Delta\to\infty$ prefactors? See Yin et al? See Appendix D of \cite{msz15} for the pillow geometry that underlies the variable $q$.

Use low central charge notations ($\beta$ not $b$) because more examples. Rare are solved CFTs with large $c$.

\section{Basic structures}

In this section we will introduce the basic structures of conformal field theory: conformal symmetry, fields, and operator product expansions. In particular, we will focus on the two ingredients of exact solvability: \textit{local} conformal symmetry and \textit{degenerate} fields. We begin with the Virasoro algebra, which describes local conformal transformations. 

\subsection{The Virasoro algebra and its representations}\label{sec:vir}

\subsubsection{The Virasoro algebra}

Let us consider the Riemann sphere $\overline{\mathbb{C}}=\mathbb{C}\cup \{\infty\}$, equipped with the metric $ds^2 = dzd\bar z$. By definition, a conformal transformation of a Riemannian manifold is a transformation that preserves angles. On any open subset of the Riemann sphere, a map $z\to f(z)$ is conformal if and only if it is holomorphic. It is indeed straightforward to show that any holomorphic map is conformal,
because it transforms the metric into itself, up to a scalar factor: 
\begin{align}
 dzd\bar z\to dfd\bar f = |f'(z)|^2 dzd\bar z\ .
\end{align}
Let us define the \textbf{Witt algebra} as the Lie algebra of infinitesimal conformal transformations on $\mathbb{C}^*= \mathbb{C}-\{0\}$. This algebra describes local conformal symmetry for quantum field theory on the Riemann sphere, as can be argued in two alternative ways:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Transformations need not be defined at $z=\infty$ because they are local, and can be singular at $z=0$ if we insert a field at that point.
 \item Holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{C}^*$ are equivalent to holomorphic functions on a neighbourhood of the circle $|z|=1$, which can be interpreted as a Euclidean time slice where the states of our theory live. 
\end{itemize}
The Witt algebra is infinite-dimensional, with the basis 
\begin{align}
 \left(\ell_n\right)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}  \quad \text{with} \quad \ell_n = -z^{n+1}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\ ,
 \label{lpz}
\end{align}
and the commutation relations 
\begin{align}
 [\ell_n,\ell_m] = (n-m)\ell_{m+n}\ .
\end{align}
The generators of the Witt algebra include the translation generator $\ell_{-1} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$, and the dilation generator $\ell_0 = -z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$. In fact, $(\ell_{-1},\ell_0,\ell_1)$ generate the infinitesimal conformal transformations on the full Riemann sphere.
The corresponding Lie group is the group of global conformal transformations $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$, whose elements act as 
\begin{align}
 z \mapsto \frac{az+b}{cz+d}\quad , \quad (a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{C},\ ad-bc\neq 0)\ .
 \label{abcd}
\end{align}
Now, in a quantum theory, symmetries act projectively on states. And projective representations of an algebra are equivalent to representations of that algebra's central extension. Therefore, the algebra that describes local conformal transformations in conformal field theory is the Witt algebra's central extension, called the Virasoro algebra. The \textbf{Virasoro algebra} $\mathfrak{V}$ has generators $(L_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ that correspond to the Witt algebra generators, plus a central generator $\mathbf 1$. The commutation relations are 
 \begin{align}
  [\mathbf 1, L_n] = 0 \quad , \quad \boxed{[L_n,L_m] = (n-m)L_{n+m} +\frac{c}{12}(n-1)n(n+1)\delta_{n+m,0}\mathbf 1} \ .
  \label{vir}
 \end{align}
 The \textbf{central charge} $c\in\mathbb{C}$ is a fundamental parameter not only of the Virasoro algebra, but also of any conformal field theory built on that algebra. 

\subsubsection{Highest-weight representations}\label{sec:hwr}

In a conformal field theory, the spectrum is a representation of the Virasoro algebra, and can be decomposed into indecomposable representations. But which indecomposable representations are physically relevant? To answer this question, we will focus on the properties of the generator $L_0$ of the Virasoro algebra. Conceptually, this is because $L_0$ can be interpreted as the energy operator. Technically, since $L_0$ generates dilations, it controls the convergence of operator product expansions, as we will see in Section \ref{sec:ope}. More specifically, a necessary condition for convergence is that the eigenvalues of $L_0$ be bounded from below in any indecomposable representation. We will always work under this assumption.

%We now make the further technical assumption that $L_0$ be diagonalizable. This assumption holds in Liouville theory and minimal models, and also in many representations that appear in other solvable CFTs. However, it does not hold in the logarithmic representations of Section \ref{sec:log}. 

The eigenvalues of $L_0$ are called \textbf{conformal dimensions}. Under the action of the Virasoro generator $L_n$, the conformal dimension decreases by $n$:
\begin{align}
 L_0|v\rangle = \Delta|v\rangle \quad \Rightarrow\quad  L_0 L_n|v\rangle = L_nL_0|v\rangle + [L_0, L_n] |v\rangle  = (\Delta-n)L_n|v\rangle \ .
\end{align}
In an indecomposable representation $\mathcal{R}$, the $L_0$-eigenstate $|v\rangle$ with the lowest eigenvalue $\Delta$ must therefore be annihilated by $L_{n>0}$:
\begin{align}
  L_0 |v\rangle = \Delta |v\rangle \quad , \quad L_{n>0} |v\rangle = 0\ .
 \end{align}
Any nonzero state that obeys these conditions is called a \textbf{primary state}, even if its eigenvalue is not the smallest. Let us introduce a basis of \textbf{creation operators},
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{L} = \left\{\prod_{i=1}^k L_{-n_i} \right\}_{k\in\mathbb{N},\ 0<n_1\leq \dots \leq n_k}==\left\{1, L_{-1}, L_{-1}^2, L_{-2},\cdots \right\}\ .
 \label{lcm}
\end{align}
Any state of the type $L |v\rangle$ with $L\in\mathcal{L}$ is called a \textbf{descendant state} of that primary state. Let  $N=|L|=\sum_{i=1}^k n_i \in\mathbb{N}$ be the  \textbf{level} of that state, then its conformal dimension is $\Delta+N$. By extension, a linear combination of descendant states is also called a descendant state. 

A primary state $|v\rangle \in \mathcal{R}$ generates a subrepresentation $\mathcal{R}_{|v\rangle}\subset\mathcal{R}$, which is the space of its descendant states. The states $L |v\rangle$ generate $\mathcal{R}_{|v\rangle}$. If they are linearly independent, then $\mathcal{R}_{|v\rangle}$ is called the \textbf{Verma module} $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$. More generally, $\mathcal{R}_{|v\rangle}$ is a quotient of $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$ by a subrepresentation (trivial or not): such quotients are called \textbf{highest-weight representations}. In such a representation, $L_0$ is diagonalizable. 
Let us sketch a Verma module by displaying all its basis states up to the level $N=3$, with arrows representing the action of the Virasoro generators $L_{-1},L_{-2},L_{-3}$:
\begin{align}
 \begin{tikzpicture}[scale = .25, baseline=(current  bounding  box.center)]
  \draw[-latex, very thick] (20, 0) -- (20, -21) node [right] {$N$};
  \foreach \x in {0, ..., 3}
  {
  \draw [dotted] (-20, {-6*\x}) -- (20, {-6*\x}) node [right] {${\x}$};
  }
  \node[fill = white] at (0, 0) (0) {$|v\rangle$};
  \node[fill = white] at (-4,-6) (1) {$L_{-1}|v\rangle$};
  \node[fill = white] at (-8, -12) (11) {$L_{-1}^2|v\rangle$};
  \node[fill = white] at (-12, -18) (111) {$L_{-1}^3|v\rangle$};
  \node[fill = white] at (0,-12) (2) {$L_{-2}|v\rangle$};
  \node[fill = white] at (0,-18) (12) {$L_{-1}L_{-2}|v\rangle$};
  \node[fill = white] at (8,-18) (3) {$L_{-3}|v\rangle$};
  \draw[-latex] (0) -- (1);
  \draw[-latex] (1) -- (11);
  \draw[-latex] (11) -- (111);
  \draw[-latex] (0) -- (2);
  \draw[-latex] (0) -- (3);
  \draw[-latex] (2) -- (12);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Null vectors of Verma modules}\label{sec:nvvm}

In a representation of the Virasoro algebra, we define a \textbf{null vector} or singular vector as a primary state that is a descendant of another primary state. Null vectors play an important structural role: a highest-weight representation is irreducible if and only if it has no null vector. 

Let us look for null vectors in the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$. This can be done level by level, starting with level $1$. That level is generated by a single state $L_{-1}|v\rangle$. To determine whether that state is primary, we take $n\geq 1$ and compute 
\begin{align}
L_n L_{-1}|v\rangle = [L_n, L_{-1}] |v\rangle = (n+1) L_{n-1}|v\rangle = 
\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 0 &  \quad \text{if } n\geq 2\ , \\ 2\Delta |v\rangle & \quad \text{if } n = 1\ . \end{array}\right. 
\end{align}
Therefore, $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$ has a null vector at level $1$ if and only if $\Delta=0$. Next, consider the case of level $2$, where we write states as 
\begin{align}
 |\chi\rangle = \left(a^{L_{-1}^2} L_{-1}^2 + a^{L_{-2}} L_{-2}\right) |v\rangle\ ,
\end{align}
where $a^{L_{-1}^2}$ and $a^{L_{-2}}$ are complex coefficients. It is easy to show that $L_{n\geq 3}|\chi\rangle=0$, and we compute 
\begin{align}
 L_1|\chi\rangle &= \left((4\Delta+2)a^{L_{-1}^2} + 3a^{L_{-2}}\right) L_{-1}|v\rangle\ ,
 \label{l1c}
\\
L_2 |\chi \rangle &= \left(6\Delta a^{L_{-1}^2}+(4\Delta+\tfrac12 c) a^{L_{-2}}\right)|v\rangle\ .
\label{l2c}
\end{align}
Therefore, the condition $L_1|\chi\rangle=L_2 |\chi \rangle=0$ for $|\chi\rangle$ to be a null vector boil down to a system of two linear equations for the coefficients $(a^{L_{-1}^2},a^{L_{-2}})$. The vanishing of that system's determinant determines the conformal dimension $\Delta$ as a function of the central charge $c$,
\begin{align}
 \Delta = \frac{1}{16}\left( 5-c\pm\sqrt{(c-1)(c-25)} \right) \ .
 \label{dpm}
\end{align}
Solving CFTs will lead to fairly complicated formulas, which would become even more complicated if we tolerated a square root at this early and elementary stage.
To get rid of the square root, we rewrite the central charge in terms a the parameter $\beta$ such that 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{c = 1- 6\left(\beta - \beta^{-1}\right)^2 } \ .
\end{align}
Then the conformal dimensions \eqref{dpm} of the two Verma modules that have null vectors become 
$
 \Delta = -\frac12 + \frac34\beta^{\pm 2}
$. The price to pay for this simplification is that the four values $\beta,-\beta,\beta^{-1},-\beta^{-1}$ all correspond to the same central charge. 

More generally, there is an infinite family of conformal dimensions $(\Delta_{(r, s)})_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ such that $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{(r, s)}}$ has a null vector $|\chi_{\langle r,s\rangle}\rangle = L_{\langle r,s\rangle} |v\rangle$ at level $N=rs$. Let us summarize the cases $N=1,2$ in these notations:
\begin{align}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
N & (r, s) & \Delta_{(r, s)} &  L_{\langle r,s\rangle} 
\\
\hline\hline
1 & (1, 1) & 0 &  L_{-1}
\\
\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{2} & 
(2, 1) & -\frac12 + \frac34 \beta^{2}  & L_{-1}^2 -\beta^{2} L_{-2}
\\
\cline{2-4}
& (1, 2) & -\frac12 + \frac34 \beta^{-2} & L_{-1}^2 -\beta^{-2} L_{-2} 
\\
\hline
\end{array}
\label{ars}
\end{align}
To write $\Delta_{(r, s)}$ for any $r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*$, we rewrite the conformal dimension in terms of the momentum $P$ defined by 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\Delta = \frac{c-1}{24} + P^2}\ .
 \label{dp}
\end{align}
The conformal dimension is invariant under the \textbf{reflection} $P\to -P$. The dimensions $\Delta_{(r, s)}$ correspond to the momentums 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{P_{(r, s)} = \frac12\left(r\beta -s\beta^{-1}\right)}\ ,
 \label{prs}
\end{align}
and it follows that the null vector $|\chi_{\langle r,s\rangle}\rangle$ is a primary state of dimension
\begin{align}
 \Delta_{(r, s)} + rs = \Delta_{(r, -s)}\ , 
 \label{drms}
\end{align}
We will provide a derivation of $P_{(r, s)}$ using operator product expansions in Section \ref{sec:dope}. On the other hand, the expressions for the null vectors $|\chi_{\langle r,s\rangle}\rangle$ themselves are complicated and not particularly useful. 

For $\beta^2\in\mathbb{C}-\mathbb{Q}$, the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$ has a null vector if and only if $\Delta=\Delta_{(r, s)}$ for some $r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*$, in which case it has only one null vector. For $\beta^2\in\mathbb{Q}$ however, a Verma module can have several null vectors. If $\beta^2 = \frac{q}{p}$ with $p,q$ coprime integers, we indeed have the identity
\begin{align}
 \Delta_{(r+p,s+q)} = \Delta_{(r,s)}\ ,
 \label{rpsq}
\end{align}
which together with $\Delta_{(r,s)}=\Delta_{(-r,-s)}$ implies infinitely many coincidences of the type $\Delta_{(r,s)}=\Delta_{(r',s')}$. 
Whenever $r',s'>0$, the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$ has a null vector $|\chi_{\langle r',s'\rangle}\rangle= L_{\langle r',s'\rangle} |v\rangle$. 
Moreover, if we apply the identity \eqref{rpsq} to the dimension $\Delta_{(r',-s')}$ \eqref{drms} of that null vector, we find that it is itself of the type $\Delta_{\langle r'',s''\rangle}$. If $r'',s''>0$, this leads to another null vector $L_{\langle r'',s''\rangle}L_{\langle r',s'\rangle} |v\rangle$. It turns out that all null vectors of Verma modules are of the type $L_{\langle r',s'\rangle} |v\rangle$ or $L_{\langle r'',s''\rangle}L_{\langle r',s'\rangle} |v\rangle$: in particular, $L_{\langle r''',s'''\rangle}L_{\langle r'',s''\rangle}L_{\langle r',s'\rangle} |v\rangle$ is of the type $L_{\langle r'''',s''''\rangle} |v\rangle$.

 Numbers of null vectors depend a lot on the sign of $\beta^2$. If $\beta^2<0$, then $\{\Delta_{(r, s)}\}_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ is bounded from above, and Eq. \eqref{drms} implies that a Verma module can only have finitely many null vectors. If $\beta^2>0$, then by Eq. \eqref{rpsq} the existence of a null vector implies the existence of infinitely many others: 
\begin{align}
 \begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|}
  \hline 
  \text{Value of }\beta^2 & \mathbb{C}-\mathbb{Q} & \mathbb{Q}_{>0} & \mathbb{Q}_{<0}
  \\
  \hline 
  \#\text{null vectors in } \mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{(r, s)}} & 1 & \infty & \text{finite} 
  \\
  \hline 
 \end{array}
\end{align}
To illustrate the differences between these two cases, let us plot at each $(r,s)\in \{1,\dots, 10\}^2$ a dot whose size increases with 
$\Delta_{(r,s)}$, together with the vector $(p, q)$ of Eq. \eqref{rpsq} as a red arrow:
\begin{align}
 \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(base), scale = .5]
 \coordinate (base) at (0, 4);
  \draw[latex-latex] (0, 10) node [left] {$s$} -- (0, 0) node[below left] {$0$} -- (10, 0) node [below] {$r$};

  \filldraw (\r, \s) circle [radius = \myrad pt];
  }}

 \qquad \qquad

  \filldraw (\r, \s) circle [radius = \myrad pt];
  }}
  \node at (5, -2) {$\beta^2 = -\frac35<0$};
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Vanishing and non-vanishing null vectors}

When a representation $\mathcal{R}$ has a null vector $|\chi\rangle=L|v\rangle$, this allows us to define a quotient representation $\frac{\mathcal{R}}{\mathcal{R}_{|\chi\rangle}}$ by setting the null vector to zero. 
By an abuse of terminology, we say that $\frac{\mathcal{R}}{\mathcal{R}_{|\chi\rangle}}$ has a \textbf{vanishing null vector}, which really means that the primary state $|v\rangle$ obeys the \textbf{null vector equation} $L|v\rangle=0$. On the other hand, $\mathcal{R}$ itself has a non-vanishing null vector $|\chi\rangle$. 

If $\mathcal{R}$ has several null vectors, we can define various quotient representations by setting some null vectors to zero. A \textbf{degenerate} representation is a representation that has at least one vanishing null vector. A degenerate representation is partly degenerate if it has some non-vanishing null vectors, and fully degenerate if all null vectors vanish. Partly degenerate representations play an important role in CFTs with extended chiral algebras, such as conformal Toda theories \cite{fl07c}. But all degenerate representations that we will consider will be fully degenerate. 

For $r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*$, let us call $\mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ the fully degenerate quotient of the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,s\rangle}}$. If $\beta^2\in \mathbb{C}-\mathbb{Q}$, we simply have 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\rangle} \ \underset{\beta^2\in \mathbb{C}-\mathbb{Q}}{=}\ \frac{\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,s\rangle}}}{\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,-s\rangle}}}\ . 
 \label{rvv}
\end{align}
If $\beta^2\in \mathbb{Q}$, the fully degenerate quotient can generally not be obtained by setting one null vector to zero, but it is always enough to set two null vectors to zero, with all other null vectors being descendants of these two. Schematically,
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\rangle} = \frac{\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,s\rangle}}}{\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r',-s'\rangle}}+ \mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r'',-s''\rangle}}}\ .
\end{align}


\subsection{Fields and operator product expansions}\label{sec:fope}

The fundamental objects of conformal field theory are fields. A field $V_{|w\rangle}(z)$ depends on a vector $|w\rangle$ in a \textbf{space of states} $\mathcal{S}$, and on a position $z\in\overline{\mathbb{C}}$ in the Riemann sphere. In the bootstrap approach, which is axiomatic rather than constructive, we need not define fields. Rather, we use fields as convenient notations for stating properties of correlation functions, which we will introduce in Section \ref{sec:cor}. 

\subsubsection{Fields, primary fields, degenerate fields}

We assume that the field $V_{|w\rangle}(z)$ belong to a vector space, such that the \textbf{state-field correspondence} $|w\rangle \to V_{|w\rangle}(z)$ is linear and bijective. The Virasoro algebra acts on the space of states, and the state-field correspondence allows us to define its action on fields,
\begin{align}
 L_n^{(z)} V_{|w\rangle}(z) = L_n V_{|w\rangle}(z) = V_{L_n|w\rangle}(z)\ ,
\end{align}
where $L_n$ is an abbreviated notation for $L_n^{(z)}$. By the correspondence, primary states and descendant states give rise to \textbf{primary fields} and \textbf{descendant fields}. In particular, a primary state $|v\rangle$ of conformal dimension $\Delta$ gives rise to a primary field $V_{|v\rangle}(z)=V_\Delta(z)$, which obeys 
\begin{align}
 L_0 V_\Delta(z) = \Delta V_\Delta(z) \quad , \quad  L_{n> 0} V_\Delta(z) = 0 \ .
 \label{lvdv}
\end{align}
If $\Delta=\Delta_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ with $r,s\in \mathbb{N}^*$, the existence of null vectors in the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$ makes the definition of $V_\Delta(z)$ a priori ambiguous. In that case, we reserve the name $V_\Delta(z)$ for a primary field that generates $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$, and write $V_{\langle r,s\rangle}(z)$ for a \textbf{degenerate field} that generates the fully degenerate representation $\mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\rangle}$, and therefore obeys not only Eq. \eqref{lvdv}, but also the null vector equation
\begin{align}
L_{\langle r, s\rangle} V_{\langle r,s\rangle}(z) = 0\ .
\end{align}

The dependence of fields on the coordinate $z$ is determined by the assumption that the Virasoro generator $L_{-1}$ generates translations, just like its counterpart $\ell_{-1}$ \eqref{lpz} from the Witt algebra:
\begin{align}
  \boxed{\frac{\partial}{\partial z} V_{|w\rangle}(z) = L_{-1} V_{|w\rangle}(z)}  \ .
  \label{pvlv}
 \end{align}
 Applying this to $L_n^{(z)} V_{|w\rangle}(z)$, we find how the Virasoro generator $L_n^{(z)}$ depends on $z$,
 \begin{align}
 \frac{\partial}{\partial z} L_n^{(z)} = [L_{-1}^{(z)},L_n^{(z)}]= -(n+1)L_{n-1}^{(z)}\ ,\qquad (\forall n\in\mathbb{Z})\ .
\end{align}
This can be rewritten as the $z$-independence of a formal Laurent series that combines all the generators $(L_n^{(z)})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$, 
\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \frac{L_n^{(z)}}{(y-z)^{n+2}} = 0\ ,\qquad (\forall y\in\mathbb{C}-\{z\})\ .
\end{align}
This formal Laurent series is then called the \textbf{energy-momentum tensor}, 
\begin{align}
  \boxed{T(y) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \frac{L_n^{(z)}}{(y-z)^{n+2}}} \ .
  \label{tl}
 \end{align}
 A priori, this only makes sense when acting on a field $V_{|w\rangle}(z)$,
 \begin{align}
 T(y)V_{|w\rangle}(z) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \frac{L_n V_{|w\rangle}(z)}{(y-z)^{n+2}}\quad , \quad L_n V_{|w\rangle}(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{z}dy\ (y-z)^{n+1} T(y)V_{|w\rangle}(z)\ .
 \label{lvtv}
\end{align}
However, we will shortly interpret $T(y)$ as a field, and $T(y)V_{|w\rangle}(z)$ as an operator product expansion of two fields. For the moment, let us apply this equation to a primary field $V_\Delta(z)$. Using Eq. \eqref{pvlv} and writing the regular terms as $O(1)$, we obtain a new form of the definition of a primary field of dimension $\Delta$,
\begin{align}
 \boxed{T(y)V_\Delta(z) = \frac{\Delta}{(y-z)^2} V_\Delta(z) + \frac{1}{y-z} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} V_\Delta(z) + O(1)}\ . 
 \label{tvd}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Operator product expansions}\label{sec:ope}

The fundamental axiom of conformal field theory, which underlies the conformal bootstrap approach, is the existence of \textbf{operator product expansions (OPEs)}. This axiom states that there exists a bilinear product on the space of fields. Given a basis $(|w_i\rangle)_i$ of the space of states $\mathcal{S}$, this reads 
\begin{align}
  \boxed{V_{|w_1\rangle}(z_1)V_{|w_2\rangle}(z_2) = \sum_i C^i_{12}(z_1,z_2) V_{|w_i\rangle}(z_2)}\ ,
  \label{ope}
 \end{align}
for some \textbf{OPE coefficients} $C^i_{12}(z_1,z_2)$. Operator product expansions generally exist in quantum field theory, but they are particularly powerful in conformal field theory because they are supposed to hold for any $z_1$ in a finite neighbourhood of $z_2$ (but $z_1\neq z_2$), and not just asymptotically as $z_1\to z_2$. The finite neighbourhood in question may depend on the correlation function in which we perform the OPE, and also on the basis $(|w_i\rangle)_i$. 

We further assume that the product of fields is commutative,
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V_{|w_1\rangle}(z_1)V_{|w_2\rangle}(z_2) = V_{|w_2\rangle}(z_2)V_{|w_1\rangle}(z_1)}\ .
 \label{comm}
\end{align}
This implies that OPEs are commutative and associative. However, the resulting constraints on the coefficients $C^i_{12}(z_1,z_2)$ are not particularly simple, because of having to choose a position ($z_2$ in our conventions) for the fields in the right-hand side of the OPE \eqref{ope}. 

We also assume that there exists an \textbf{identity field} $I(z)$ whose OPE with any other field is trivial, namely $I(z_1)V_{|w\rangle}(z_2) = V_{|w\rangle}(z_2)$. Let the \textbf{vacuum state} $|\text{vac}\rangle\in \mathcal{S}$ be the corresponding state, i.e. $I(z) = V_{|\text{vac}\rangle}(z)$. Let us consider the energy-momentum tensor $T$ as a field, then we have 
$
 T(y)I(z) = T(y) = T(z)  + O(y-z)
$. 
Comparing this with Eq. \eqref{lvtv} applied to $I(z)$, we find 
\begin{align}
 L_{n\geq -1} I(z) = 0 \quad , \quad T(z) = L_{-2}I(z)\ .
\end{align}
In particular, the identity field is a degenerate primary field of conformal dimension zero, with a vanishing null vector at level $1$, i.e. $I(z) \propto V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}(z)$. And the energy-momentum tensor is a descendant of that field.
OPEs that involve the energy-momentum tensor provide a way of rewriting not only the definition of primary fields \eqref{tvd}, but also the commutation relations of the Virasoro algebra itself: 
\begin{align}
 T(y)T(z) = \frac{\frac{c}{2}}{(y-z)^4} + \frac{2T(z)}{(y-z)^2} + \frac{\partial T(z)}{y-z} + O(1)\ .
\label{tt}
\end{align}
Via the definition \eqref{tl} of $T(y)$, this OPE is equivalent to the commutation relations \eqref{vir}.

\subsubsection{Conformal symmetry constraints on OPEs}

For technical simplicity, we focus on an OPE of two primary fields. In that OPE, we single out the contributions of a primary field $V_\Delta$ and its descendants:
\begin{align}
 V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset \sum_{L\in \mathcal{L}} C_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta, L}(z_1,z_2) LV_\Delta(z_2) \ ,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{L}$ \eqref{lcm} is the set of creation operators. On both sides of the OPE, we insert $\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{z_1,z_2} dy (y-z_2)^{n+1}T(y)$ with $n\geq -1$, where the integration contour encloses both $z_1$ and $z_2$. Using Eqs. \eqref{lvtv} and \eqref{tvd}, we find
\begin{align}
 \left(L_n^{(z_2)} +z_{12}^{n+1}\partial_{z_1} + (n+1)z_{12}^n\Delta_1\right) V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset \sum_{L\in \mathcal{L}} C_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta, L}(z_1,z_2)L_nLV_\Delta(z_2) \ .
\end{align}
We distinguish three cases:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\boxed{n=-1}$\ : We use Eq. \eqref{pvlv} for $V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$ and $LV_{\Delta}(z_2)$, and perform the OPE again on the left-hand side. This leads to $(\partial_{z_1}+\partial_{z_2})C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}(z_1,z_2)=0$, i.e. translation invariance of the OPE coefficients.
 \item $\boxed{n=0}$\ : We use $L_0LV_{\Delta}(z_2)= (\Delta+|L|) V_{\Delta}(z_2)$, and perform the OPE again on the left-hand side. This leads to $(z_{12}\partial_{z_1}+\Delta_1+\Delta_2-\Delta-|L|)C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}(z_1,z_2) = 0$, and we deduce the dependence of OPE coefficients on $z_1,z_2$:
 \begin{align}
  C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}(z_1,z_2) = z_{12}^{\Delta+|L|-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}\ . 
 \end{align}
\item $\boxed{n\geq 1}$\ : We use $L_n^{(z_2)}V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)=0$, and perform the OPE again on the left-hand side. The action of the differential operator on the OPE coefficients is now known, and we find 
\begin{align}
 \sum_{L\in\mathcal{L}} C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}z_{12}^{|L|+n}(\Delta+|L|+n\Delta_1-\Delta_2) LV_{\Delta}(z_2)= \sum_{L\in\mathcal{L}} C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}z_{12}^{|L|}L_n LV_{\Delta}(z_2)\ .
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
This leads to a system of linear equations for the OPE coefficients $C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}$, called \textbf{OPE Ward identities}. It turns out that for $\Delta\notin \left\{\Delta_{(r,s)}\right\}_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$, this system has a unique solution $\left(f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}\right)_{L\in\mathcal{L}}=\left(f^L\right)_{L\in\mathcal{L}}$, assuming that the coefficient of the primary field is normalized as
$f^{1}=1$. Let us illustrate this claim by deriving the first few coefficients $f^{L_{-1}},f^{L_{-1}^2},f^{L_{-2}}$. Let us write the term of order $O(z_{12})$ of the $n=1$ OPE Ward identity, i.e. $L=1$ on the left and $L=L_{-1}$ on the right:
\begin{align}
 (\Delta+\Delta_1-\Delta_2)V_\Delta(z_2) = f^{L_{-1}} L_1L_{-1}V_\Delta(z_2)=2\Delta f^{L_{-1}}V_\Delta(z_2)\ .
 \label{dddv}
\end{align}
This determines $f^{L_{-1}}$, except if its coefficient vanishes, which occurs if and only if there is a null vector at level one in the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$, i.e. if and only if $\Delta=\Delta_{(1,1)}=0$. In the resulting expression, the null vector manifests itself as a simple pole at $\Delta=0$:
\begin{align}
 f^{L_{-1}} = \frac{\Delta+\Delta_1-\Delta_2}{2\Delta}\ . 
 \label{fl1}
\end{align}
Similarly, the level two coefficients $f^{L_{-1}^2},f^{L_{-2}}$ are determined by the $O(z_{12}^2)$ terms in the $n=1,2$ OPE Ward identities. If we write $|v\rangle$ the primary state that corresponds to $V_\Delta$, and $|\chi\rangle = \left(f^{L_{-1}^2}L_{-1}^2 + f^{L_{-2}}L_{-2}\right) |v\rangle$, these equations read 
\begin{align}
 (\Delta+1+\Delta_1-\Delta_2)f^{L_{-1}}L_{-1}|v\rangle  &= L_1|\chi\rangle\ ,
 \label{el1c}
 \\
 (\Delta+2\Delta_1-\Delta_2)|v\rangle  &=L_2|\chi\rangle \ .
 \label{el2c}
\end{align}
This is a system of linear equations for $f^{L_{-1}^2},f^{L_{-2}}$, whose homogeneous part is the condition that $|\chi\rangle$ be a null vector. This is why the determinant vanishes if and only if $\Delta\in \left\{\Delta_{(2,1)},\Delta_{(1,2)}\right\}$. Otherwise, the solution is unique. 

To summarize, the contributions of $V_\Delta$ and its descendants in an OPE of two primary fields read
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset  C_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta} z_{12}^{\Delta-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} \Bigg(V_\Delta(z_2) +\sum_{L\in \mathcal{L}-\{1\}}z_{12}^{|L|} f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2} LV_\Delta(z_2)\Bigg)}
 \ ,
 \label{prope}
\end{align}
where the \textbf{OPE structure constant} $C^\Delta_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}$ is left undetermined by conformal symmetry, while the dependence on $z_1,z_2$ and the coefficients $f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}$ are universal quantities that are in principle known. The coefficient $f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}$ depends on the conformal dimensions and also on the central charge, and has simple poles at $\Delta=\Delta_{(r,s)}$ with $r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*$ such that $rs\leq |L|$. 

In the case of the OPE coefficients $C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}(z_1,z_2)$, we have seen that the primary field determines the contributions of its descendant fields. This will also be true in correlation functions, as a result of Virasoro symmetry. However, this would not necessarily hold if we had a larger chiral symmetry algebra such as a W-algebra. 

The form of the dependence on $z_1,z_2$ provides an a posteriori justification for our assumption in Section \ref{sec:hwr} that $L_0$-eigenvalues be bounded from below. We have indeed seen that a descendant state at level $|L|$ (with $L_0$-eigenvalue $\Delta+|L|$) comes with a factor $z_{12}^{|L|}$. This helps the sum over descendants converge in a neighbourhood of $z_1=z_2$. 


\subsubsection{Fusion rules and fusion products}\label{sec:dope}

The appearance of poles in OPE coefficients is a hint that when degenerate conformal dimensions $(\Delta_{(r,s)})_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ are involved, there are constraints on the fields that can appear in a given OPE. Let us derive these constraints in the simplest case $\Delta_{(1,1)}=0$. There are two types of primary fields of dimension $0$: the non-degenerate field $V_0$, which generates the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_0$, and the degenerate field $V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$, which obeys the null vector equation $L_{-1}V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}=\partial V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}=0$ and generates the degenerate representation $\mathcal{R}_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$. While the OPE $V_0(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$ is just a special case of the OPE \eqref{prope}, 
the null vector equation implies 
\begin{align}
 0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial z_1} V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset C_{\langle 1,1\rangle,\Delta_2}^{\Delta} \frac{\partial}{\partial z_1} z_{12}^{\Delta-\Delta_2} \left(V_\Delta(z_2) +\cdots \right) \ ,
\end{align}
therefore $V_\Delta$ may appear in $V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$ only provided $\Delta=\Delta_2$. This agrees with the remark (in Section \ref{sec:ope}) that $V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$ is proportional to the identity field. 

Then let us study the subtler question of whether $V_0$ or $V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$ may appear in $V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$. In the case of $V_0$, the pole of $f^{L_{-1}}$ \eqref{fl1} means that our normalization condition $f^1=1$ was wrong: we in fact have $f^1=0$ while $f^{L_{-1}}\neq 0$. Therefore, the non-vanishing null vector $L_{-1}V_0$ may appear in the OPE, together with its descendants, while $V_0$ itself and its other descendants give vanishing contributions. In the case of $V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$ however, the null vector vanishes, and no descendant of $V_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$ may appear --- unless the left-hand side of the OPE Ward identity \eqref{dddv} vanishes, which happens if $\Delta_1=\Delta_2$. 

Let us introduce the \textbf{fusion rules} as a convenient notation for writing constraints on OPEs, by omitting everything but the primary fields:
\begin{align}
 V_{\langle 1,1\rangle} V_{\Delta} = V_\Delta \quad , \quad V_{\Delta_1} V_{\Delta_2} \ni V_{\langle 1,1\rangle} \implies \Delta_1=\Delta_2\ . 
\end{align}
In terms of representations of the Virasoro algebra, this can may be rewritten in terms of a \textbf{fusion product} such that 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}_{\langle 1,1\rangle} \times \mathcal{V}_\Delta = \mathcal{V}_\Delta \quad , \quad \dim\text{Hom}\left(\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_1}\times \mathcal{V}_{\Delta_2}, \mathcal{R}_{\langle 1,1\rangle}\right) = \delta_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}\ ,
 \label{rtv}
\end{align}
where $\text{Hom}(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{R}')$ is the space of linear maps from $\mathcal{R}$ to $\mathcal{R}'$ that commute with the action of the Virasoro algebra. 
Such a fusion product can be algebraically defined \cite{gab99}. It differs from the tensor product, in particular its definition involves the fields' positions, although the resulting product does not. Just like OPEs, the fusion product is commutative and associative. Moreover, as we just saw in the case of Verma modules, we have an isomorphism
\begin{align}
 \text{Hom}\left(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{R}'\right) \simeq \text{Hom}\left(\mathcal{R}\times\mathcal{R}',\mathcal{R}_{\langle 1,1\rangle}\right)\ . 
 \label{hrr}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Fusion products of degenerate representations}

Thanks to the isomorphism \eqref{hrr}, we can find the fusion rules of $V_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ by studying whether it may appear in an OPE $V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$. This amounts to finding whether the two-dimensional linear system \eqref{el1c}, \eqref{el2c} has a solution, even though it is of rank one. With the help of Eq. \eqref{l1c}, \eqref{l2c}, this condition boils down to 
\begin{align}
 \left(4\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}+2\right) \left(\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}+¨2\Delta_1-\Delta_2\right) = 3\left(\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}+\Delta_1-\Delta_2\right)\left(\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}+1+\Delta_1-\Delta_2\right)\ .
\end{align}
Using the expression \eqref{ars} for $\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$, and replacing conformal dimensions with momentums \eqref{dp}, this equation reduces to 
\begin{align}
 \prod_{\pm,\pm}\left(\tfrac{\beta}{2}\pm P_1\pm P_2\right) = 0\ . 
\end{align}
This leads to the fusion rules of $V_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$, from which the fusion rules of $V_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ are deduced by $\beta\to \beta^{-1}$. We write these fusion rules in terms of fusion products, where we index Verma modules by their momentums:
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\mathcal{R}_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P = \sum_\pm \mathcal{V}_{P\pm \frac{\beta}{2}}} \quad, \quad \boxed{\mathcal{R}_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P = \sum_\pm \mathcal{V}_{P\pm \frac{1}{2\beta}}}\ . 
 \label{rvvp}
\end{align}
From these simple formulas, all the discrete spectrums of Section \ref{sec:sesc} will follow. For the moment, let us deduce the fusion products of higher degenerate representations $\mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\rangle}$, using the associativity of the fusion product. We start with the remark that a highest-weight representation $\mathcal{R}$ is degenerate if and only if its fusion product with any Verma module $\mathcal{R}\times \mathcal{V}_P$ has finitely many terms:
\begin{itemize}
 \item If $\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ is degenerate, the condition that $V_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ may appear in the OPE $V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$ leads to polynomial equations of order $rs$ on $\Delta_1,\Delta_2$, just as we saw in the case $(r,s)=(2,1)$. These equations may be interpreted as conditions on residues of OPE coefficients,
 \begin{align}
  V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset V_{\langle r,s\rangle} \quad \implies \quad \forall L\in \mathcal{L},\ \underset{\Delta=\Delta_{(r,s)}}{\operatorname{Res}} f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2} = 0\ .
  \label{resf}
 \end{align}
 (If the residues vanish for $|L|=rs$, then they vanish for all $L\in\mathcal{L}$.)
 \item If $\mathcal{R}$ is not degenerate, the corresponding primary field may appear in any OPE of the type $V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$, because the OPE Ward identities have a unique solution (up to normalization). 
\end{itemize}
It follows that a fusion product of degenerate representations is itself a sum of degenerate representations. 
For example, according to Eq. \eqref{rvvp}, the product $\mathcal{R}_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times\mathcal{R}_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ is the sum of two representations of momentums $\{P_{(2,1)} \pm \frac{\beta}{2}\} = \{P_{(1,1)},P_{(3,1)}\}$. These representations must be degenerate, therefore $\mathcal{R}_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times\mathcal{R}_{\langle 2,1\rangle}=\mathcal{R}_{\langle 1,1\rangle}+\mathcal{R}_{\langle 3,1\rangle}$. By associativity of $\mathcal{R}_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times\mathcal{R}_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P$, we then deduce 
$
 \mathcal{R}_{\langle 3,1\rangle} \times \mathcal{V}_P = \mathcal{V}_{P-\beta}+\mathcal{V}_P+\mathcal{V}_{P+\beta}
$. Iterating this reasoning over $r$ or $s$, we obtain 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times \mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\rangle} 
 \underset{r\geq 2}{=} \sum_\pm \mathcal{R}_{\langle r\pm 1,s\rangle} 
 \quad , \quad 
 \mathcal{R}_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\times \mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\rangle} 
 \underset{s\geq 2}{=}\sum_\pm \mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\pm 1\rangle} \ .
 \label{rrrs}
\end{align}
This allows us to find the fusion product of any degenerate representation with a Verma module, by iteration over $r$ and $s$:
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P = \sum_{i=-\frac{r-1}{2}}^{\frac{r-1}{2}} \sum_{j=-\frac{s-1}{2}}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} \mathcal{V}_{P+i\beta +j\beta^{-1}}}\ ,
 \label{rrsvp}
\end{align}
where the sums run by increments of $1$. Since this sum has $rs$ terms, the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$ must have a null vector at level $rs$, a result that we admitted in Section \ref{sec:nvvm}, and which we now derived using fusion products. Fusion can even be used to compute the null vectors themselves \cite{fms97}. 

We can then find the fusion product $\mathcal{R}_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle}\times \mathcal{R}_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}$, either by again iterating over $r_1$ and $s_1$, or by summing the degenerate representations whose momentums appear in both  $\mathcal{R}_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_{P_{(r_2,s_2)}}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_{P_{(r_1,s_1)}}$:
\begin{align}
  \boxed{\mathcal{R}_{\langle r_1,s_1 \rangle} \times \mathcal{R}_{\langle r_2,s_2 \rangle} = \sum_{r\overset{2}{=}|r_1-r_2|+1}^{r_1+r_2-1}\ \sum_{s\overset{2}{=}|s_1-s_2|+1}^{s_1+s_2-1} \mathcal{R}_{\langle r,s \rangle}}\ ,
  \label{rrsr}
\end{align}
where the sums now run by increments of $2$. 


\subsection{Correlation functions}\label{sec:cor}

Correlation functions are observables of quantum field theory: quantities that we can in principle compute, and compare with experimental data. We will focus on $N$-point functions on the Riemann sphere: functions of $N$ distinct positions $z_1,z_2,\dots, z_N\in \overline{\mathbb{C}}$, which depend on $n$ states $|w_1\rangle,|w_2\rangle,\dots, |w_N\rangle$, and are written in terms of $n$ fields as 
\begin{align}
 \Big< V_{|w_1\rangle}(z_1) V_{|w_2\rangle}(z_2) \cdots V_{|w_N\rangle}(z_N)\Big>\ . 
\end{align}
Correlation functions are assumed to depend linearly on fields: in particular, this implies $\partial_{z_1}\left<  V_{|w_1\rangle}(z_1) \cdots \right> = \left< \partial_{z_1} V_{|w_1\rangle}(z_1) \cdots \right>$.
All the assumptions and results of Section \ref{sec:fope} may be understood as constraints on correlation functions. 
In two-dimensional CFT, there are other observables that we will not consider, such as: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Correlation functions on higher-genus Riemann surfaces, starting with the torus. 
 \item Correlation functions on Riemann surfaces with boundaries, starting with the disc. 
 \item Correlation functions in the presence of defect lines. 
 \item Entanglement entropy. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conformal symmetry constraints}

In order to derive the crossing symmetry constraints for an $N$-point function of primary fields $Z$, it is convenient to consider the $N+1$-point function $Z(y)$ that also includes the energy-momentum tensor $T(y)$:
\begin{align}
 Z = \left< \prod_{i=1}^N V_{\Delta_i}(z_i)\right> \quad , \quad Z(y) = \left< T(y)\prod_{i=1}^N V_{\Delta_i}(z_i)\right>\ .
\end{align}
The function $Z(y)$ is meromorphic, with $N$ poles at $y=z_i$, where its behaviour is constrained by the OPE $T(y)V_{\Delta_i}(z_i)$ \eqref{tvd}. To fully determine $Z(y)$, it remains to determine its behaviour at $y=\infty$. Because our fields live on the Riemann sphere, they must be smooth at $y=\infty$: in the case of $T(y)$, we assume that this means 
\begin{align}
 T(y) \underset{y\to\infty} = O\left(\frac{1}{y^4}\right)\ .
 \label{tinf}
\end{align}
This implies first of all that $\lim_{y\to \infty} Z(y)=0$, therefore $Z(y)$ is completely determined by its residues at $y=z_i$:
\begin{align}
 Z(y) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac{\Delta_i}{(y-z_i)^2} +\frac{1}{y-z_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}\right) Z\ .
 \label{zy}
\end{align}
Furthermore, Eq. \eqref{tinf} implies the vanishing of the coefficients of $y^{-1},y^{-2},y^{-3}$ in the Laurent expansion of $Z(y)$ near $y=\infty$, leading to the three \textbf{global Ward identitites} 
\begin{align}
 \sum_{i=1}^N \partial_{z_i} Z = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(z_i \partial_{z_i} + \Delta_i\right) Z = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(z_i^2 \partial_{z_i} + 2\Delta_iz_i\right) Z = 0\ .
 \label{gward}
\end{align}
Equivalently, the behaviour of $Z$ under global conformal transformations \eqref{abcd} must be
\begin{align}
 \left< \prod_{i=1}^N  V_{\Delta_i}\left(\frac{az_i+b}{cz_i+d}\right) \right>
 = \prod_{i=1}^N (cz_i +d)^{2\Delta_i} \left< \prod_{i=1}^N V_{\Delta_i}(z_i) \right>\ .
 \label{zgc}
\end{align}
In particular, considering the transformation $z\mapsto \frac{1}{z}$ leads to $V_\Delta(z)\underset{z\to\infty}{=} O(z^{-2\Delta})$, which allows us to define 
\begin{align}
 V_\Delta(\infty) = \lim_{z\to\infty} z^{2\Delta}V_\Delta(z)\ . 
 \label{vdi}
\end{align}
The global Ward identities are valid not only for primary fields, but also for \textbf{global primary fields} (also called quasi-primary fields): $L_0$-eigenvectors that are annihilated by $L_1$ but not necessarily by $L_{n\geq 2}$. According to the OPE $T(y)T(z)$ \eqref{tt}, the energy-momentum tensor is a global primary field of dimension $\Delta=2$, and the resulting behaviour at infinity is consistent with our assumption \eqref{tinf}. 

Let us solve the global Ward identities in the cases $N=1,2,3,4$. We have $3$ linear differential equations in the $N$ variables $z_i$, and we write their solutions up to $z_i$-independent prefactors:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \boxed{$N=1$}\ : The identities amount to $\partial_{z_1} Z = \Delta_1 Z=0$, and their solution is 
 \begin{align}
  \left<V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)\right>\propto \delta_{\Delta_1,0}\ . 
 \end{align}
 \item \boxed{$N=2$}\ : Similarly, there are more Ward identities than variables in $Z$, leading to $Z\neq 0\implies \Delta_1=\Delta_2$, and to the solution
 \begin{align}
 \Big< V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \Big> \propto \delta_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2} z_{12}^{-2\Delta_1} \ .
 \label{2pt}
\end{align}
\item \boxed{$N=3$}\ : With as many Ward identities as variables, we have a unique solution with no constraints on the conformal dimensions:
\begin{align}
 \left< \prod_{i=1}^3 V_{\Delta_i}(z_i) \right> \propto z_{12}^{\Delta_3-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} z_{13}^{\Delta_2-\Delta_1-\Delta_3} z_{23}^{\Delta_1-\Delta_2-\Delta_3}\ .
 \label{3pt}
\end{align}
\item \boxed{$N=4$}\ : The solution involves an arbitrary function $G(z)$ of the cross-ratio $z=\frac{z_{12}z_{34}}{z_{13}z_{24}}$:
\begin{align}
 \left< \prod_{i=1}^4 V_{\Delta_i}(z_i) \right> 
 \propto z_{13}^{-2\Delta_1} z_{23}^{\Delta_1-\Delta_2-\Delta_3+\Delta_4} z_{24}^{-\Delta_1-\Delta_2+\Delta_3-\Delta_4} z_{34}^{\Delta_1+\Delta_2-\Delta_3-\Delta_4} G\left(\frac{z_{12}z_{34}}{z_{13}z_{24}}\right)\ .
 \label{4pt}
\end{align}
A four-point function is therefore completely determined by its dependence on $1$ of its $4$ variables. In particular, it can be convenient to choose the fixed values $(z_1,z_2,z_3)=(0,\infty,1)$. Using Eq. \eqref{vdi}, this leads to 
\begin{align}
 \Big< V_{\Delta_1}(z) V_{\Delta_2}(0)V_{\Delta_3}(\infty)V_{\Delta_4}(1) \Big> \propto G(z)\ . 
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
In addition to global Ward identities, there are \textbf{local Ward identities}, which follow from $\oint_\infty dy\ \epsilon(y)Z(y)=0$, where $\epsilon(y)$ is a meromorphic function such that $\epsilon(y)\underset{y\to\infty}{=}O(y^2)$, with poles at $y=z_i$. Local Ward identities allow us to determine correlation functions of descendant fields from the corresponding correlation functions of primary fields, thereby justifying of focus on primary fields. In the case $\epsilon(y) = \frac{1}{(y-z_1)^{n-1}}$ with $n\geq -1$, using the expressions \eqref{zy} for $Z(y)$ and \eqref{lvtv} for $L_{-n}V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)$, we obtain the Ward identity
\begin{align}
 \left<L_{-n}V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)\prod_{j=2}^N V_{\Delta_j}(z_j)\right> = \sum_{j=2}^N \left(-\frac{1}{z_{j1}^{n-1}}\frac{\partial}{\partial z_j} +\frac{n-1}{z_{j1}^n} \Delta_j\right) \left<\prod_{j=1}^N V_{\Delta_j}(z_j)\right>\ . 
 \label{lwi}
\end{align}
If $n\geq 2$ this is a local Ward identity, while for $n=-1,0,1$ we recover global Ward identities. 

\subsubsection{Single-valuedness and chiral factorization}

We assume that correlation functions are single-valued functions on the Riemann sphere. However, correlation functions are of the type of $z^\Delta$, which is multivalued unless $\Delta\in\mathbb{Z}$. Single-valued functions like $|z|^{2\Delta}=z^\Delta\bar{z}^\Delta$ are not written in terms of powers of $z$, but also involve $\bar z$. In the literature, the notation $f(z,\bar z)$ is sometimes used for arbitrary functions of $z$, with $f(z)$ reserved to locally holomorphic functions, i.e. functions such that $\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z} f(z) =0$. We will not use the notation $f(z,\bar z)$, which is redundant since $\bar z$ is itself a function of $z$. However, the generators $\ell_n$ \eqref{lpz} of local conformal transformations are only valid when acting on locally holomorphic functions: for more general functions, the generators are 
\begin{align}
 \ell_n +\bar{\ell}_n \quad , \quad i(\bar\ell_n -\bar \ell_n)\  .
 \label{epbe}
\end{align}
In fact we want the algebra of conformal transformations to act on a complex vector space: the space of complex-valued functions on $\overline{\mathbb{C}}$ for the Witt algebra, the space of states of the CFT for the Virasoro algebra. We should therefore complexify our symmetry algebra, and we obtain two copies of the Virasoro algebra: a \textbf{left-moving or holomorphic} Virasoro algebra $\mathfrak{V}$ with generators $L_n$, and a \textbf{right-moving or antiholomorphic} Virasoro algebra $\bar{\mathfrak{V}}$ with generators $\bar{L}_n$. In the case of the algebra of global conformal transformations, we start with the 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$, with generators \eqref{epbe} with $n=-1,0,1$, and the complexification yields $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})^\mathbb{C} = \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\times \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$.

In Sections \eqref{sec:vir} and \eqref{sec:ope}, we have been doing \textbf{chiral CFT}, which means considering $\mathfrak{V}$ only. In a full CFT, the symmetry algebra is the \textbf{conformal algebra} $\mathfrak{V}\times \bar{\mathfrak{V}}$, where for simplicity we assume that the left and right central charges are equal. When it comes to representations, Verma modules of $\mathfrak{V}\times \bar{\mathfrak{V}}$ are simply $\mathcal{V}_\Delta\otimes \bar{\mathcal{V}}_{\bar \Delta}$, where we write a bar over representations of $\bar{\mathfrak{V}}$. There are also representations of $\mathfrak{V}\times \bar{\mathfrak{V}}$ that are not themselves factorized. We will encounter such representations in Section \ref{sec:log}. 

Fields now belong to representations of $\mathfrak{V}\times \bar{\mathfrak{V}}$, and they obey $\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z} V_{|w\rangle}(z) = \bar L_{-1} V_{|w\rangle}(z)$, which is the antiholomorphic version of Eq. \eqref{pvlv}. This allows us to define a right-moving energy-momentum tensor $\bar T(y) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \frac{\bar L_n^{(z)}}{(\bar y-\bar z)^{n+2}}$. While $T$ is locally holomorphic, $\bar T$ is locally antiholomorphic:
\begin{align}
 \partial_{\bar z} T(z) = 0 \quad , \quad \partial_z \bar T(z) = 0 \ . 
\end{align}
Let $V_i(z)$ be a field that is primary with respect to the conformal algebra, with the left dimension $\Delta_i$ and the right dimension $\bar\Delta_i$. The difference of these dimensions is called the \textbf{conformal spin}
\begin{align}
 S_i = \Delta_i -\bar\Delta_i\ . 
 \label{sdd} 
\end{align}
In order to write correlation functions, let us define the \textbf{modulus squared notation} 
\begin{align}
 \left| f(\Delta, z)\right|^2 = f(\Delta, z)f(\bar\Delta,\bar z)\ ,
 \label{fdz2}
\end{align}
where $z,\bar z$ are complex conjugates, while $\Delta,\bar\Delta$ are generally not. The solution of the left- and right-moving global Ward identities for 2-point functions is the modulus squared of Eq. \eqref{2pt},
\begin{align}
\boxed{ \Big< V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2) \Big> = B_{12} \left|\delta_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2} z_{12}^{-2\Delta_1}\right|^2} \ ,
\label{2ptb}
\end{align}
where the constant, $z_i$-independent coefficient is now called the \textbf{2-point structure constant} $B_{12}$. Similarly, 3-point functions are given by the modulus squared of Eq. \eqref{3pt},
\begin{align}
 \boxed{  \Big< V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2)V_3(z_3) \Big> = C_{123} \left|z_{12}^{\Delta_3-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} z_{13}^{\Delta_2-\Delta_1-\Delta_3} z_{23}^{\Delta_1-\Delta_2-\Delta_3}\right|^2 }\ ,
 \label{3ptc}
\end{align}
where $C_{123}$ is the \textbf{3-point structure constant}. Single-valuedness of the 2-point and 3-point functions implies that spins obey
\begin{align}
 S_i\in\frac12 \mathbb{Z} \quad , \quad S_1+S_2+S_3 \in\mathbb{Z}\ . 
\end{align}
Now we have assumed that fields commute \eqref{comm}, but the $z_i$-dependent factors of the 2-point and 3-point functions are not invariant under permutations. This implies that structure constants behave as
\begin{align}
 B_{21} = (-)^{2S_1} B_{12} \quad ,\quad C_{\sigma(1)\sigma(2)\sigma(3)} = \text{sign}(\sigma)^{S_1+S_2+S_3} C_{123}\ , 
 \label{b21}
\end{align}
where $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\{1,2,3\}$. In particular, for the 2-point function of a field with itself, we have $B_{12}=B_{21}$, which must vanish if the spin is half-integer $S_1\in \frac12+\mathbb{Z}$. Fields with half-integer spins should rather anti-commute with themselves, i.e. they should be fermionic. We will assume that spins are integer unless otherwise stated,
\begin{align}
 \boxed{S\in \mathbb{Z}}\ .
 \label{siz}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Crossing symmetry and conformal blocks}

Let us systematically use OPEs for simplifying correlation functions. Knowing the contribution \eqref{prope} of left-moving descendants of primary fields, the complete OPE of two primary fields reads 
\begin{align}
 V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2) = \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}} C_{12}^k \left|z_{12}^{\Delta_k-\Delta_1-\Delta_2}\sum_{L\in\mathcal{L}} z_{12}^{|L|}f_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta_k,L}\right|^2 V_k(z_2)\ ,
\end{align}
where we assume that all fields are primaries or descendants thereof, and redefine the spectrum $\mathcal{S}$ as a basis of primaries. Let us insert this OPE in a three-point function, and focus on the leading terms as $z_1\to z_2$. Using the 2-point function \eqref{2ptb}, we obtain
\begin{align}
  \Big< V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2)V_3(z_3) \Big> \underset{z_1\to z_2}{\sim} 
  \left|z_{12}^{\Delta_3-\Delta_1-\Delta_2}z_{23}^{-2\Delta_3}\right|^2 
  \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}\left|\substack{\Delta_3=\Delta_k\\ \bar{\Delta}_3=\bar\Delta_k}\right. }
  C_{12}^k B_{k3}\ .
\end{align}
Comparing with the 3-point function \eqref{3ptc}, this implies a relation between the 2-point, 3-point and OPE structure constants, 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{C_{123} = C_{12}^k B_{k3}}\ .
 \label{ccb}
\end{align}
If the basis of fields is such that $B_{ij}=\delta_{ij}B_i$, and in particular if two different primary fields never share the same conformal dimensions, the sum over $k$ reduces to one term, and the relation reduces to $C_{123} = C_{12}^3B_{3}$. 

Inserting the OPE in the four-point function $\left<V_1(z)V_2(0)V_3(\infty)V_4(1)\right>$, we obtain a linear combination of 3-point functions of the type $\left<L\bar{L}V_k(0) V_3(\infty)V_4(1)\right>$ with $L,\bar L\in\mathcal{L}$. Deducing 3-point functions of descendants from 3-point functions of primaries using local Ward identities, we can in principle compute the ratios
\begin{align}
 g^L_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\Delta_3} = \frac{\left< LV_{\Delta_1}(0) V_{\Delta_2}(\infty)V_{\Delta_3}(1)\right>}{\left< V_{\Delta_1}(0) V_{\Delta_2}(\infty)V_{\Delta_3}(1)\right>}\ .
\end{align}
This allows us to write our 4-point function as 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\Big<V_1(z)V_2(0)V_3(\infty)V_4(1)\Big> = \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}} C_{12}^k C_{k34} \left|\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_{\Delta_k}\left(c\middle|\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\Delta_3,\Delta_4\middle|z\right)\right|^2}  \ ,
 \label{sdec}
\end{align}
where we introduce the \textbf{$s$-channel Virasoro blocks}, which are known (in principle) functions of $z$ as well as the central charge and conformal dimensions:
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{F}_{\Delta}^{(s)}\left(c\middle|\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\Delta_3,\Delta_4\middle|z\right) = z^{\Delta-\Delta_1-\Delta_2}\sum_{L\in\mathcal{L}} z^{|L|} f_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta,L}g^L_{\Delta,\Delta_3,\Delta_4}\ ,
 \label{fsl}
\end{align}
The $s$-channel decomposition \eqref{sdec} reduces the 4-point function to a combination of model-dependent structure constants, and universal Virasoro blocks. Repeatedly using OPEs, any $N$-point function can likewise be decomposed into $N$-point Virasoro blocks. However, these decompositions are not unique. In the case $N=4$, there are 3 possible decompositions, called the \textbf{$s$-channel}, \textbf{$t$-channel} and \textbf{$u$-channel} decompositions, depending on which OPE we perform. For each channel, let us write the relevant OPE, the \textbf{4-point structure constants} that appear as coefficients, the asymptotics of the Virasoro blocks, and a diagram that represents the decomposition:
\begin{align}
 \begin{array}{|r||c|c|c|}
  \hline 
  \text{Channel} & s & t & u
  \\ \hline\hline 
  \text{OPE} & V_1(z)V_2(0) & V_1(z)V_4(1) & V_1(z)V_3(\infty)
  \\ \hline 
  \text{4-point} & D^{(s)}_k = C_{12}^k C_{k34} & D^{(t)}_k = C_{41}^k C_{k23} & D^{(u)}_k = C_{13}^k C_{k42}
\\ \hline 
  \text{Asymptotics} & \mathcal{F}^{(s)}_{\Delta}\underset{z\to 0}{\sim} z^{\Delta-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} & \mathcal{F}^{(t)}_{\Delta}\underset{z\to 1}{\sim} (1-z)^{\Delta-\Delta_1-\Delta_4}
  & \mathcal{F}^{(u)}_\Delta  \underset{z\to \infty}{\sim} \left(\tfrac{1}{z}\right)^{\Delta+\Delta_1-\Delta_3}
  \\
  \hline 
\text{Diagram} & & & 
  \\
  \hline 
 \end{array}
 \label{stu}
\end{align}



where the \textbf{$s$-channel conformal block} $\mathcal{G}^{(s)}_{\Delta_k}$ is a  With our assumption that all fields are primaries or descendants, conformal blocks are chirally factorized into \textbf{$s$-channel Virasoro blocks}

namely we have 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{G}^{(s)}_{\Delta_k} = \left|\mathcal{F}_{\Delta_k}^{(s)}\right|^2 \ . 
 \label{gf2}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
 \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}} D_k^{(s)} \mathcal{G}^{(s)}_{\Delta_k}
\end{align}



Then 4pt that depends on $z$. 3 inequivalent decompositions, start with $s$-channel. Non-chiral blocks! Chiral factorization of blocks, with abstract formula for Virasoro blocks as sums over descendants. 

Equality of channels, crossing symmetry equations for struct. csts and spectrum. Channel-dependent spectrums. Spectrum arbitrariness. 

Not just linear, due to factorization. But 
4-point factorization not true if multiplicities, so not that constraining. 

CFT data 

\section{Sketching exactly solvable CFTs}\label{sec:sesc}

A \textbf{spinless field} is a primary field whose spin vanishes. Spinless fields are often called diagonal, but in Section \ref{sec:sesc} we will define diagonal fields as a subclass of spinless fields. 

\textbf{diagonal field}

What is a CFT? symmetry algebra has fields that may not belong to the space of states. Space of states not very well defined when continuum. 


Use deg. fields rather than torus partition fct. We lose Verlinde formula for fusion rules but we get them otherwise. Our method is more elementary. Degeneracy of fields can be hard to deduce from partition fct. 

Diagonal fields. Non-diagonal fields. Get logarithmic fields by degenerate fusion.

Start with GMM. Then focus on rational central charge, get MM. If we take limit, we presumably get log-MM. 

Get D-series, can we get E-series? 

Deduce Liouville with $c\leq 1$ by taking a limit. Then get Liouville for generic $c$. Other limits of diag CFT: RWT. Limit of non-diagonal MM.

Then reduce to one degenerate field. Maximal spectrum is $O(n)$. Depends on $\beta^2$, not $c$. Cannot really argue for Potts, but does not matter much. Anyway, at this stage, we know nothing about global symmetry.

Brownian loop soup: presumably has higher symmetry.

Ashkin--Teller does have higher symmetry, solved wrt Virasoro nevertheless.

Criterion for $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}$ limit to become logarithmic? For 4pt function, criterion about vanishing of residues, which depends on fusion rules being obeyed for NV? In MM case we completely escape log. reps, criterion should account for that.  
For $c>25$, what happens to GMM at rational $b^2$? Concidences of dimensions boil down to $\Delta_{(r,s)}-\Delta_{(r,-s)} \in \mathbb{Z}$ modulo $(p, -q)$. 

How much to say about limits? Reread my results on limits of 4pt functions, try to infer general rules on appearance of logarithms, depending on fusion rules?


\section{Degenerate four-point functions}

Could be interpreted as using OPE associativity for $V^{deg}VV$ just like we did for $TVV$ and getting constraints on interchiral descendants. 

\subsection{BPZ equations and their solutions}

Non-diagonal, simplify it as much as possible. Non-diagonal solution. 

Loop weights are invariant under shifts, left undetermined. 

$s\to s+1$ shift equations can be violated, cf Potts model. $s\to s+2$ may be derived from $(1,2)$ deg. field but are always obeyed if $(1,3)$ exists. 

Do not try to rederive monodromies of BPZ equations! 

\subsection{Exact solutions for structure constants}

Deduce analytic properties of correlation functions, and limits of CFTs. 

Do we want a synthetic table of known solutions? 

\begin{itemize}
\item Invariance of $C_{(r_1,s_1)(r_2,s_2)(r_3,s_3)}$ under permutations of $1,2,3$
\item Reduction to $C_{P_1,P_2,P_3}$ if $\forall i, r_i=0$ 
 \item $V_{\langle 1,2\rangle}^d$ shift equations $\implies$ $s_i\to s_i+2$  
 \item Parity $\forall i, (r_i,s_i)\to (r_i,-s_i)$, reflection $(r_i,s_i)\to (-r_i,-s_i)$
\end{itemize}


\section{Numerical bootstrap}

Synthesis of what precedes?

Notion of interchiral symmetry. Liouville 4pt is only one interchiral block? Same for MM, including non-diagonal. Distinguish double interchiral from simple interchiral, cf nb of deg. fields. 

Sketch method. Start with Zamolodchikov recursion.

\subsection{Virasoro conformal blocks and Zamolodchikov's recursion}


\section{Logarithmic representations and fields} \label{sec:log}

Not clear where to put this section. Before conformal blocks or after?

We need log reps. Can deduce them from non-log using degenerate fields. Issue is conceptually less important if we adopt interchiral symmetry, since logarithms only appear for interchiral descendants. 

To get log reps we need associativity of OPE of degenerate field. We might say that this does not belong to the chiral, algebraic part of the review. However, to get conformal blocks we need associativity of OPEs of the energy-momentum tensor. Again, interchiral point of view changes things! And we need bootstrap axioms, including single-valuedness? 

Emergence of logarithms: $\Delta_{P+\frac{\beta}{2}}-\Delta_{P-\frac{\beta}{2}} = \beta P$ integer $\implies P=P_{(0,s)}$. This calculation is a diagonal version of the argument about integer spin that leads to non-diagonal $O(n)$ spectrum.

In $V_{\langle 1,2\rangle}V^N_{(r,0)} = \sum_\pm V^N_{(r,\pm 1)}$ it is not just spins but also dimensions that differ by integers. 

Need we assume that $V^N_{(r,0)}$ is the limit of diagonal fields? Why would we not get $V_{P_{(r,0)}}$? Are there two ways to take the limit? See OPE coefficients.
