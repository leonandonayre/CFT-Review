\section{Introduction}

Sketch map of CFTs according to symmetry: deg. fields, no deg. fields, local conf. sym, global conf. sym.

CFTs that are exactly solvable with known methods = bootstrap, analytic and numerical. Only Virasoro. Do not characterize with twist gap, as symmetry cannot be inferred from spectrum: chiral symmetry fields might be absent from spectrum. Also, affine abelian symmetry can be present in spectrum but absent in interactions. (Is there a strong statement that unitary CFTs do not have these pathologies?)

Forget Coulomb gas, a dead end. For correl fct, applies only if we have two deg. fields? But used to find spectrum of $O(n)$ etc. Larger symmetry allows many generalizations, but tend to be always more complicated. (Liouville not solved from WZW, quite the opposite.) No modular bootstrap. 

Exact solution means analytic expression for 3-point structure constants. Here: CFTs that are presumed to be solvable, not necessarily solved. 

Focus on correl fct: no modular bootstrap, no KPZ. These methods are efficient at getting the spectrum but we can get it otherwise. 

This review: only necessary calculations. Derive the recursion for blocks? hard part is coef $R_{r,s}$ but it obeys simple shift equations. Rewrite it in terms of Upsilon functions, and somehow derive it from Liouville theory! But cancellation of double poles hard to argue? And need to determine sign, since we get square of $R_{r,s}$. We can choose any value of the continuous parameters including $c$, but is there a value that makes $R_{r,s}$ simple enough? And what about the $\Delta\to\infty$ prefactors? See Yin et al? See Appendix D of \cite{msz15} for the pillow geometry that underlies the variable $q$.

Use low central charge notations ($\beta$ not $b$) because more examples. Rare are solved CFTs with large $c$.

Brownian loop soup: presumably has higher symmetry.

Historically, the spectrums and fusion rules of solvable CFTs have been derived by studying the torus partition function. The torus partition function is a simple object that only depends and the spectrum, and not on the structure constants. It can be computed either by solving modular invariance equations, or constructively via a path integral or a lattice sum. And in rational CFTs, the modular invariance equations involve the modular S-matrix, which also allows us to determine the fusion rules via the Verlinde formula \cite{fms97}.

Here, we will follow a simpler approach, based on exploiting the fusion rules of degenerate fields. We do not lose in generality, because all known exactly solvable CFTs have degenerate fields. And we gain in flexibility: in many cases, adding fields to the spectrum is consistent with fusion rules, but breaks modular invariance. For example, in the Ising model, the modular invariant torus partition function only involves three primary fields, and excludes disorder fields, as well as the fields that are needed for computing connectivities of clusters.

\section{Basics of two-dimensional CFT}\label{sec:bo}

In this section we introduce conformal symmetry, fields, operator product expansions, and correlation functions. In particular, we emphasize the two ingredients of exact solvability: \textit{local} conformal symmetry and \textit{degenerate} fields. We begin with the Virasoro algebra, which describes local conformal transformations. 

\subsection{The Virasoro algebra and its representations}\label{sec:vir}

\subsubsection{The Virasoro algebra}

Let us consider the Riemann sphere $\overline{\mathbb{C}}=\mathbb{C}\cup \{\infty\}$, equipped with the metric $ds^2 = dzd\bar z$. By definition, a \textbf{conformal transformation} of a Riemannian manifold is a transformation that preserves angles. On any open subset of the Riemann sphere, a map $z\to f(z)$ is conformal if and only if it is holomorphic. It is indeed straightforward to show that any holomorphic map is conformal,
because it transforms the metric into itself, up to a scalar factor: 
\begin{align}
 dzd\bar z\to dfd\bar f = |f'(z)|^2 dzd\bar z\ .
\end{align}
Let us define the \textbf{Witt algebra} as the Lie algebra of infinitesimal conformal transformations on $\mathbb{C}^*= \mathbb{C}-\{0\}$. This algebra describes local conformal symmetry for quantum field theory on the Riemann sphere, as can be argued in two alternative ways:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Transformations need not be defined at $z=\infty$ because they are local, and can be singular at $z=0$ if we insert a field at that point.
 \item Holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{C}^*$ are equivalent to holomorphic functions on a neighbourhood of the circle $|z|=1$. In radial quantization, this circle is interpreted as a Euclidean time slice where the states of our theory live. 
\end{itemize}
The Witt algebra is infinite-dimensional, with the basis 
\begin{align}
 \left(\ell_n\right)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}  \quad \text{with} \quad \ell_n = -z^{n+1}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\ ,
 \label{lpz}
\end{align}
and the commutation relations 
\begin{align}
 [\ell_n,\ell_m] = (n-m)\ell_{m+n}\ .
\end{align}
The generators of the Witt algebra include the translation generator $\ell_{-1} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$, and the dilation generator $\ell_0 = -z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$. In fact, $(\ell_{-1},\ell_0,\ell_1)$ generate the infinitesimal conformal transformations of the Riemann sphere.
The corresponding Lie group is the group of \textbf{global conformal transformations} $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$, whose elements act as 
\begin{align}
 z \mapsto \frac{az+b}{cz+d}\quad , \quad (a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{C},\ ad-bc\neq 0)\ .
 \label{abcd}
\end{align}
Now, in a quantum theory, symmetries act projectively on states. And projective representations of an algebra are equivalent to representations of that algebra's central extension. Therefore, the algebra that describes local conformal transformations in conformal field theory is the Witt algebra's central extension, called the Virasoro algebra. The \textbf{Virasoro algebra} $\mathfrak{V}$ has generators $(L_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ that correspond to the Witt algebra generators, plus a central generator $\mathbf 1$. The commutation relations are 
 \begin{align}
  [\mathbf 1, L_n] = 0 \quad , \quad \boxed{[L_n,L_m] = (n-m)L_{n+m} +\frac{c}{12}(n-1)n(n+1)\delta_{n+m,0}\mathbf 1} \ .
  \label{vir}
 \end{align}
 The \textbf{central charge} $c\in\mathbb{C}$ is a fundamental parameter not only of the Virasoro algebra, but also of any conformal field theory built on that algebra. 

\subsubsection{Highest-weight representations}\label{sec:hwr}

In a conformal field theory, the space of states is a representation of the Virasoro algebra, and can be decomposed into indecomposable representations. But which indecomposable representations are physically relevant? To answer this question, we will focus on the properties of the generator $L_0$ of the Virasoro algebra. Conceptually, this is because $L_0$ can be interpreted as the energy operator. Technically, since $L_0$ generates dilations, it controls the convergence of operator product expansions, as we will see in Section \ref{sec:csope}. More specifically, a necessary condition for convergence is that the eigenvalues of $L_0$ be bounded from below in any indecomposable representation. We will always assume that this condition holds.

The eigenvalues of $L_0$ are called \textbf{conformal dimensions}. Under the action of the Virasoro generator $L_n$, the conformal dimension decreases by $n$. For any vector $V$ in a representation of the Virasoro algebra, we indeed have 
\begin{align}
 L_0V{} = \Delta V{} \quad \Rightarrow\quad  L_0 L_nV{} = L_nL_0V{} + [L_0, L_n] V{}  = (\Delta-n)L_nV{} \ .
\end{align}
In an indecomposable representation $\mathcal{R}$, the $L_0$-eigenstate with the lowest eigenvalue must therefore be annihilated by $L_{n>0}$. This eigenstate is therefore a \textbf{primary state}, where we define a primary state $V_\Delta$ of conformal dimension $\Delta$ by 
\begin{align}
  \boxed{L_0 V_\Delta = \Delta V_\Delta \quad , \quad L_{n>0} V_\Delta = 0}\ .
 \end{align}
Let us introduce a basis of \textbf{creation operators},
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{L} = \left\{\prod_{i=1}^k L_{-n_i} \right\}_{k\in\mathbb{N},\ 0<n_1\leq \dots \leq n_k}==\left\{1, L_{-1}, L_{-1}^2, L_{-2},\cdots \right\}\ .
 \label{lcm}
\end{align}
Any state of the type $L V{}$ with $L\in\mathcal{L}$ is called a \textbf{descendant state} of that primary state. Let  $N=|L|=\sum_{i=1}^k n_i \in\mathbb{N}$ be the  \textbf{level} of that state, then its conformal dimension is $\Delta+N$. By extension, a linear combination of descendant states is also called a descendant state. 

A primary state $V{} \in \mathcal{R}$ generates a subrepresentation $\mathcal{R}_{V{}}= \text{Span}(LV{})_{L\in\mathcal{L}}\subset\mathcal{R}$, which is the space of its descendant states. If the states $(LV{})_{L\in\mathcal{L}}$ are linearly independent, then $\mathcal{R}_{V{}}$ is called the \textbf{Verma module} $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$. More generally, $\mathcal{R}_{V{}}$ is a quotient of $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$ by a subrepresentation (trivial or not): such quotients are called \textbf{highest-weight representations}. In such a representation, $L_0$ is diagonalizable. 
Let us sketch a Verma module by displaying all its basis states up to the level $N=3$, with arrows representing the action of the Virasoro generators $L_{-1},L_{-2},L_{-3}$:
\begin{align}
 \begin{tikzpicture}[scale = .25, baseline=(current  bounding  box.center)]
  \draw[-latex, very thick] (20, 0) -- (20, -21) node [right] {$N$};
  \foreach \x in {0, ..., 3}
  {
  \draw [dotted] (-20, {-6*\x}) -- (20, {-6*\x}) node [right] {${\x}$};
  }
  \node[fill = white] at (0, 0) (0) {$V{}$};
  \node[fill = white] at (-4,-6) (1) {$L_{-1}V{}$};
  \node[fill = white] at (-8, -12) (11) {$L_{-1}^2V{}$};
  \node[fill = white] at (-12, -18) (111) {$L_{-1}^3V{}$};
  \node[fill = white] at (0,-12) (2) {$L_{-2}V{}$};
  \node[fill = white] at (0,-18) (12) {$L_{-1}L_{-2}V{}$};
  \node[fill = white] at (8,-18) (3) {$L_{-3}V{}$};
  \draw[-latex] (0) -- (1);
  \draw[-latex] (1) -- (11);
  \draw[-latex] (11) -- (111);
  \draw[-latex] (0) -- (2);
  \draw[-latex] (0) -- (3);
  \draw[-latex] (2) -- (12);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Null vectors of Verma modules}\label{sec:nvvm}

In a representation of the Virasoro algebra, we define a \textbf{null vector} or singular vector as a primary state that is a descendant of another primary state. Null vectors play an important structural role: a highest-weight representation is irreducible if and only if it has no null vector. 

Let us look for null vectors in the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$. This can be done level by level, starting with level $1$. That level is generated by a single state $L_{-1}V_\Delta$. To determine whether that state is primary, let us determine how it behaves under the action of $L_{n\geq 1}$:
\begin{align}
L_n L_{-1}V_\Delta = [L_n, L_{-1}] V_\Delta = (n+1) L_{n-1}V_\Delta = 
\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 0 &  \quad \text{if } n\geq 2\ , \\ 2\Delta V_\Delta & \quad \text{if } n = 1\ . \end{array}\right. 
\end{align}
Therefore, $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$ has a null vector at level $1$ if and only if $\Delta=0$. Next, consider the case of level $2$, where we write states as 
\begin{align}
 X{} = \left(a^{L_{-1}^2} L_{-1}^2 + a^{L_{-2}} L_{-2}\right) V_\Delta\ ,
\end{align}
where $a^{L_{-1}^2}$ and $a^{L_{-2}}$ are complex coefficients. It is easy to show that $L_{n\geq 3}X{}=0$, and we compute 
\begin{align}
 L_1X{} &= \left((4\Delta+2)a^{L_{-1}^2} + 3a^{L_{-2}}\right) L_{-1}V_\Delta\ ,
 \label{l1c}
\\
L_2 X{} &= \left(6\Delta a^{L_{-1}^2}+(4\Delta+\tfrac12 c) a^{L_{-2}}\right)V_\Delta\ .
\label{l2c}
\end{align}
Therefore, the conditions $L_1X{}=L_2 X{}=0$ for $X{}$ to be a null vector boil down to a system of two linear equations for the coefficients $(a^{L_{-1}^2},a^{L_{-2}})$. The vanishing of that system's determinant determines the conformal dimension $\Delta$ as a function of the central charge $c$,
\begin{align}
 \Delta = \frac{1}{16}\left( 5-c\pm\sqrt{(c-1)(c-25)} \right) \ .
 \label{dpm}
\end{align}
Solving CFTs will lead to fairly complicated formulas, which would become even more complicated if we tolerated a square root at this early stage.
To get rid of the square root, we rewrite the central charge in terms a the parameter $\beta$ such that 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{c = 1- 6\left(\beta - \beta^{-1}\right)^2 } \ .
 \label{cb}
\end{align}
Then the conformal dimensions \eqref{dpm} become 
$
 \Delta = -\frac12 + \frac34\beta^{\pm 2}
$. The price to pay for this simplification is that the four values $\beta,-\beta,\beta^{-1},-\beta^{-1}$ all correspond to the same central charge. 

More generally, there is an infinite family of conformal dimensions $(\Delta_{(r, s)})_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ such that $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{(r, s)}}$ has a null vector $L_{\langle r,s\rangle} V_{\Delta_{(r, s)}}$ at level $N=rs$. Let us summarize the cases $N=1,2$ in these notations:
\begin{align}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
N & (r, s) & \Delta_{(r, s)} &  L_{\langle r,s\rangle} 
\\
\hline\hline
1 & (1, 1) & 0 &  L_{-1}
\\
\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{2} & 
(2, 1) & -\frac12 + \frac34 \beta^{2}  & L_{-1}^2 -\beta^{2} L_{-2}
\\
\cline{2-4}
& (1, 2) & -\frac12 + \frac34 \beta^{-2} & L_{-1}^2 -\beta^{-2} L_{-2} 
\\
\hline
\end{array}
\label{ars}
\end{align}
To write $\Delta_{(r, s)}$ for any $r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*$, we rewrite the conformal dimension in terms of the momentum $P$ defined by 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\Delta = \frac{c-1}{24} + P^2}\ .
 \label{dp}
\end{align}
We can rewrite Verma modules as $\mathcal{V}_P=\mathcal{V}_{-P}$, although the parameter $P$ is redundant due to the invariance under the \textbf{reflection} $P\to -P$. The dimensions $\Delta_{(r, s)}$ correspond to the momentums 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{P_{(r, s)} = \frac12\left(r\beta -s\beta^{-1}\right)}\ ,
 \label{prs}
\end{align}
and it follows that the null vector $L_{\langle r,s\rangle} V_{\Delta_{(r, s)}}$ is a primary state of dimension
\begin{align}
 \Delta_{(r, s)} + rs = \Delta_{(r, -s)}\ , 
 \label{drms}
\end{align}
We will provide a derivation of $P_{(r, s)}$ using operator product expansions in Section \ref{sec:dope}. On the other hand, the expressions of $L_{\langle r,s\rangle} $ are complicated and not particularly useful. 

For $\beta^2\in\mathbb{C}-\mathbb{Q}$, the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$ has a null vector if and only if $\Delta=\Delta_{(r, s)}$ for some $r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*$, in which case it has only one null vector. For $\beta^2\in\mathbb{Q}$ however, a Verma module can have several null vectors. If $\beta^2 = \frac{q}{p}$ with $p,q$ coprime integers, we indeed have the identity
\begin{align}
 \Delta_{(r+p,s+q)} = \Delta_{(r,s)}\ ,
 \label{rpsq}
\end{align}
which together with $\Delta_{(r,s)}=\Delta_{(-r,-s)}$ implies infinitely many coincidences of the type $\Delta_{(r,s)}=\Delta_{(r_1,s_1)}$ with $r_1,s_1\in\mathbb{Z}$. 
Whenever $r_1,s_1>0$, the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$ has a null vector $L_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} V_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$. 
Moreover, if we apply the identity \eqref{rpsq} to the dimension $\Delta_{(r_1,-s_1)}$ \eqref{drms} of that null vector, we find that it is itself of the type $\Delta_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}$. If $r_2,s_2>0$, this leads to another null vector $L_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}L_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} V_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$. It turns out that all null vectors of Verma modules are of the type $L_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} V_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$ or $L_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}L_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} V_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$. In particular,
\begin{align}
 \exists r_4,s_4\in \mathbb{N}^*\ , \ L_{\langle r_3,s_3\rangle}L_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}L_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} V_{\Delta_{(r,s)}} = L_{\langle r_4,s_4\rangle} V_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}\ .
 \label{lllel}
\end{align}
To see this, let $\epsilon,\eta\in\{+,-\}$ be the signs such that $P_{(-r_1,s_1)}=\epsilon P_{(r_2,s_2)}$ and $P_{(r_2,-s_2)}=\eta P_{(r_3,s_3)}$, and let $r_4=|\epsilon r_1-r_2+\eta r_3|$ and $s_4=|\epsilon s_1+s_2+\eta s_3|$, then $\sum_{i=1}^3 r_is_i=r_4s_4$, i.e. the two null vectors in Eq. \eqref{lllel} have the same level. 

 Numbers of null vectors depend a lot on the sign of $\beta^2$. If $\beta^2<0$, then $\{\Delta_{(r, s)}\}_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ is bounded from above, and Eq. \eqref{drms} implies that a Verma module can only have finitely many null vectors. If $\beta^2>0$, then by Eq. \eqref{rpsq} the existence of a null vector implies the existence of infinitely many others: 
\begin{align}
 \begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|}
  \hline 
  \text{Value of }\beta^2 & \mathbb{C}-\mathbb{Q} & \mathbb{Q}_{>0} & \mathbb{Q}_{<0}
  \\
  \hline 
  \text{Value of }c & \text{generic} & c\leq 1 , c\in\mathbb{Q} &  c\geq 25, c\in\mathbb{Q}
  \\
  \hline 
  \#\text{null vectors in } \mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{(r, s)}} & 1 & \infty & \text{finite} 
  \\
  \hline 
 \end{array}
\end{align}
To illustrate the two cases $\beta^2\in \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$ and $\beta^2\in \mathbb{Q}_{<0}$, let us plot at each $(r,s)\in \{1,\dots, 10\}^2$ a dot whose size increases with 
$\Delta_{(r,s)}$, together with the vector $(p, q)$ of Eq. \eqref{rpsq} as a red arrow:
\begin{align}
 \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(base), scale = .5]
 \coordinate (base) at (0, 4);
  \draw[latex-latex] (0, 10) node [left] {$s$} -- (0, 0) node[below left] {$0$} -- (10, 0) node [below] {$r$};

  \filldraw (\r, \s) circle [radius = \myrad pt];
  }}
  \node at (5, -2) {$\beta^2 = \frac35>0$};

 \qquad \qquad

  \pgfmathsetmacro{\myrad}{6-(3*\r+5*\s)/15}
  \filldraw (\r, \s) circle [radius = \myrad pt];
  }}
  \node at (5, -2) {$\beta^2 = -\frac35<0$};
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Vanishing and non-vanishing null vectors}

When a representation $\mathcal{R}$ has a null vector $X{}=LV{}$, this allows us to define a quotient representation $\frac{\mathcal{R}}{\mathcal{R}_{X{}}}$ by setting the null vector to zero. 
By an abuse of terminology, we say that $\frac{\mathcal{R}}{\mathcal{R}_{X{}}}$ has a \textbf{vanishing null vector}, which really means that the primary state $V{}$ obeys the \textbf{null vector equation} $LV{}=0$. On the other hand, $\mathcal{R}$ itself has a non-vanishing null vector $X{}$. 

If $\mathcal{R}$ has several null vectors, we can define various quotient representations by setting some null vectors to zero. A \textbf{degenerate representation} is a representation that has at least one vanishing null vector. A degenerate representation is partly degenerate if it has some non-vanishing null vectors, and \textbf{fully degenerate} if all null vectors vanish. Partly degenerate representations play an important role in CFTs with extended chiral algebras, such as conformal Toda theories \cite{fl07c}. But most degenerate representations that we will consider will be fully degenerate. 

For $r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*$, let us call $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ the quotient of the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,s\rangle}}$ where the null vector $L_{\langle r,s\rangle}V_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$ vanishes:
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle} 
 =\frac{\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,s\rangle}}}{\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,-s\rangle}}}\ . 
 \label{rvv}
\end{align}
If $\beta^2\in \mathbb{Q}$, the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,s\rangle}}$ in general has several null vectors, and $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ may be partly degenerate. Let us call $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ the fully degenerate quotient of  $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,s\rangle}}$: this quotient can generally not be obtained by setting one null vector to zero, but it is always enough to set two null vectors to zero, with all other null vectors being descendants of these two. Schematically,
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle} = \frac{\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r,s\rangle}}}{\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r_1,-s_1\rangle}}+ \mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{\langle r_2,-s_2\rangle}}}\ .
\end{align}
We define the \textbf{degenerate state} $V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ and \textbf{fully degenerate state} $V^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}=V^f_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle}=V^f_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}$ as the primary states of the representation $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ and 
$\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}$. These states obey the null vector equation
\begin{align}
L_{\langle r, s\rangle} V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle} = L_{\langle r, s\rangle} V^f_{\langle r,s\rangle} = 0\ .
\end{align}
The primary state $V_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$ has the same dimension as $V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ and $V^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}$, but does not necessarily obey the null vector equation. 

\subsection{Fields and operator product expansions}\label{sec:fope}

The fundamental objects of conformal field theory are fields. In quantum field theory, all states can be obtained by acting on the vacuum state with fields: this is called the \textbf{state-field correspondence} or operator-state correspondence. In conformal field theory, the correspondence is bijective, and allows us to identify the space of fields with the \textbf{space of states} or \textbf{spectrum}  --- a vector space on which the Virasoro algebra acts. To a state $V$, the correspondence associates a field $V(z)$, which depends on a position $z\in\overline{\mathbb{C}}$ in the Riemann sphere. Primary states, descendant states and degenerate states respectively give rise to \textbf{primary fields}, \textbf{descendant fields} and \textbf{degenerate fields}.

In the bootstrap approach, which is axiomatic rather than constructive, we need not define fields. Rather, we use fields as convenient notations for stating properties of correlation functions, which we will introduce in Section \ref{sec:cor}. 

\subsubsection{The energy-momentum tensor}

The dependence of fields on the coordinate $z$ is determined by the assumption that the Virasoro generator $L_{-1}$ generates translations, just like the Witt algebra generator $\ell_{-1}$ \eqref{lpz}:
\begin{align}
  \boxed{\frac{\partial}{\partial z} V(z) = L_{-1} V(z)}  \ .
  \label{pvlv}
 \end{align}
 Since fields depend on $z$, the Virasoro algebra that acts on fields also depends on $z$. This can be made explicit using the notation
\begin{align}
   L_n V(z) = L_n^{(z)} V(z) \ . 
\end{align}
Applying Eq. \eqref{pvlv} to $L_n^{(z)} V(z)$, we find how the Virasoro generator $L_n^{(z)}$ depends on $z$,
 \begin{align}
 \frac{\partial}{\partial z} L_n^{(z)} = [L_{-1}^{(z)},L_n^{(z)}]= -(n+1)L_{n-1}^{(z)}\ ,\qquad (\forall n\in\mathbb{Z})\ .
\end{align}
This can be rewritten as the $z$-independence of a formal Laurent series that combines all the generators $(L_n^{(z)})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$, 
\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \frac{L_n^{(z)}}{(y-z)^{n+2}} = 0\ ,\qquad (\forall y\in\mathbb{C}-\{z\})\ .
\end{align}
The formal Laurent series is then called the \textbf{energy-momentum tensor}, 
\begin{align}
  \boxed{T(y) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \frac{L_n^{(z)}}{(y-z)^{n+2}}} \ .
  \label{tl}
 \end{align}
 A priori, the energy-momentum tensor only makes sense when acting on a field $V(z)$,
 \begin{align}
 T(y)V(z) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \frac{L_n V(z)}{(y-z)^{n+2}}\quad , \quad L_n V(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{z}dy\ (y-z)^{n+1} T(y)V(z)\ .
 \label{lvtv}
\end{align}
However, we will shortly interpret $T(y)$ as a field, and $T(y)V(z)$ as an operator product expansion of two fields. For the moment, let us apply this equation to a primary field $V_\Delta(z)$. Using Eq. \eqref{pvlv} and writing the regular terms as $O(1)$, we obtain
\begin{align}
 \boxed{T(y)V_\Delta(z) = \frac{\Delta}{(y-z)^2} V_\Delta(z) + \frac{1}{y-z} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} V_\Delta(z) + O(1)}\ .
 \label{tvd}
\end{align}
This is equivalent to the statement that $V_\Delta(z)$ is a primary field of dimension $\Delta$.

\subsubsection{Operator product expansions}\label{sec:ope}

The fundamental axiom of conformal field theory, which underlies the conformal bootstrap approach, is the existence of \textbf{operator product expansions (OPEs)}. This axiom states that there exists a bilinear product on the space of fields. Given a basis $(V_k)_k$ of the space of states, this reads 
\begin{align}
  \boxed{V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2) = \sum_k C^k_{12}(z_1,z_2) V_k(z_2)}\ ,
  \label{ope}
 \end{align}
for some \textbf{OPE coefficients} $C^k_{12}(z_1,z_2)$. Operator product expansions generally exist in quantum field theory, but they are particularly useful in conformal field theory because they are supposed to hold for any $z_1$ in a finite neighbourhood of $z_2$ (but $z_1\neq z_2$), and not just asymptotically as $z_1\to z_2$. The finite neighbourhood in question may depend on the correlation function in which we perform the OPE, and also on the basis $(V_k)_k$. 

We further assume that the product of fields is commutative,
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2) = V_2(z_2)V_1(z_1)}\ .
 \label{comm}
\end{align}
This implies that OPEs are commutative and associative. However, the resulting constraints on the coefficients $C^i_{12}(z_1,z_2)$ are not particularly simple, because of having to choose a position ($z_2$ in our conventions) for the fields in the right-hand side of the OPE \eqref{ope}. 

We also assume that there exists an \textbf{identity field} $I(z)$ whose OPE with any other field is trivial, namely $I(z_1)V(z_2) = V(z_2)$. (The corresponding state is called the vacuum state.) Let us consider the energy-momentum tensor $T$ as a field, then we have 
$
 T(y)I(z) = T(y) = T(z)  + O(y-z)
$. 
Comparing this with Eq. \eqref{lvtv} applied to $I(z)$, we find 
\begin{align}
 L_{n\geq -1} I(z) = 0 \quad , \quad T(z) = L_{-2}I(z)\ .
\end{align}
In particular, the identity field is a degenerate primary field of conformal dimension zero, with a vanishing null vector at level $1$, i.e. $I(z) \propto V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}(z)$. And the energy-momentum tensor is a descendant of that field. The commutation relations of the Virasoro algebra \eqref{vir} are equivalent to the OPE
\begin{align}
 T(y)T(z) = \frac{\frac{c}{2}}{(y-z)^4} + \frac{2T(z)}{(y-z)^2} + \frac{\partial T(z)}{y-z} + O(1)\ .
\label{tt}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Conformal symmetry constraints on OPEs}\label{sec:csope}

For technical simplicity, we focus on an OPE of two primary fields. In that OPE, we single out the contributions of a primary field $V_\Delta$ and its descendants:
\begin{align}
 V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset \sum_{L\in \mathcal{L}} C_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta, L}(z_1,z_2) LV_\Delta(z_2) \ ,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{L}$ \eqref{lcm} is the set of creation operators. On both sides of the OPE, we insert $\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{z_1,z_2} dy (y-z_2)^{n+1}T(y)$ with $n\geq -1$, where the integration contour encloses both $z_1$ and $z_2$. Using Eqs. \eqref{lvtv} and \eqref{tvd}, we find
\begin{align}
 \left(L_n^{(z_2)} +z_{12}^{n+1}\partial_{z_1} + (n+1)z_{12}^n\Delta_1\right) V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset \sum_{L\in \mathcal{L}} C_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta, L}(z_1,z_2)L_nLV_\Delta(z_2) \ .
\end{align}
We distinguish three cases:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\boxed{n=-1}$\ : We use Eq. \eqref{pvlv} for $V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$ and $LV_{\Delta}(z_2)$, and perform the OPE again on the left-hand side. This leads to $(\partial_{z_1}+\partial_{z_2})C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}(z_1,z_2)=0$, i.e. translation invariance of the OPE coefficients.
 \item $\boxed{n=0}$\ : We use $L_0LV_{\Delta}(z_2)= (\Delta+|L|) V_{\Delta}(z_2)$, and perform the OPE again on the left-hand side. This leads to $(z_{12}\partial_{z_1}+\Delta_1+\Delta_2-\Delta-|L|)C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}(z_1,z_2) = 0$, and we deduce the dependence of OPE coefficients on $z_1,z_2$:
 \begin{align}
  C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}(z_1,z_2) = z_{12}^{\Delta+|L|-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}\ . 
 \end{align}
\item $\boxed{n\geq 1}$\ : We use $L_n^{(z_2)}V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)=0$, and perform the OPE again on the left-hand side. The action of the differential operator on the OPE coefficients is now known, and we find 
\begin{align}
 \sum_{L\in\mathcal{L}} C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}z_{12}^{|L|+n}(\Delta+|L|+n\Delta_1-\Delta_2) LV_{\Delta}(z_2)= \sum_{L\in\mathcal{L}} C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}z_{12}^{|L|}L_n LV_{\Delta}(z_2)\ .
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
This leads to a system of linear equations for the OPE coefficients $C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}$, called \textbf{OPE Ward identities}. It turns out that for $\Delta\notin \left\{\Delta_{(r,s)}\right\}_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$, this system has a unique solution $\left(f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}\right)_{L\in\mathcal{L}}=\left(f^L\right)_{L\in\mathcal{L}}$, assuming that the coefficient of the primary field is normalized as
$f^{1}=1$. Let us illustrate this claim by deriving the first few coefficients $f^{L_{-1}},f^{L_{-1}^2},f^{L_{-2}}$. Let us write the term of order $O(z_{12})$ of the $n=1$ OPE Ward identity, i.e. $L=1$ on the left and $L=L_{-1}$ on the right:
\begin{align}
 (\Delta+\Delta_1-\Delta_2)V_\Delta(z_2) = f^{L_{-1}} L_1L_{-1}V_\Delta(z_2)=2\Delta f^{L_{-1}}V_\Delta(z_2)\ .
 \label{dddv}
\end{align}
This determines $f^{L_{-1}}$, except if $\Delta=0$, i.e. if there is a null vector at level one in the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_\Delta$. In the resulting expression, the null vector manifests itself as a simple pole at $\Delta=0$:
\begin{align}
 f^{L_{-1}} = \frac{\Delta+\Delta_1-\Delta_2}{2\Delta}\ . 
 \label{fl1}
\end{align}
Similarly, the level two coefficients $f^{L_{-1}^2},f^{L_{-2}}$ are determined by the $O(z_{12}^2)$ terms in the $n=1,2$ OPE Ward identities. For $W = \left(f^{L_{-1}^2}L_{-1}^2 + f^{L_{-2}}L_{-2}\right) V_\Delta$, these equations read 
\begin{align}
 (\Delta+1+\Delta_1-\Delta_2)f^{L_{-1}}L_{-1}V_\Delta  &= L_1W\ ,
 \label{el1c}
 \\
 (\Delta+2\Delta_1-\Delta_2)V_\Delta  &=L_2W \ .
 \label{el2c}
\end{align}
This is a system of linear equations for $f^{L_{-1}^2},f^{L_{-2}}$, whose homogeneous part is the condition that $W$ be a null vector. Thererfore, the determinant vanishes if and only if $\Delta\in \left\{\Delta_{(2,1)},\Delta_{(1,2)}\right\}$. Otherwise, the solution is unique. 

To summarize, the contributions of $V_\Delta$ and its descendants in an OPE of two primary fields read
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset  C_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta} z_{12}^{\Delta-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} \Bigg(V_\Delta(z_2) +\sum_{L\in \mathcal{L}-\{1\}}z_{12}^{|L|} f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2} LV_\Delta(z_2)\Bigg)}
 \ ,
 \label{prope}
\end{align}
where the \textbf{OPE structure constant} $C^\Delta_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}$ is left undetermined by conformal symmetry, while the dependence on $z_1,z_2$ and the coefficients $f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}$ are universal quantities that are in principle known. The coefficient $f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}$ depends on the conformal dimensions and also on the central charge, and has simple poles at $\Delta=\Delta_{(r,s)}$ with $r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*$ such that $rs\leq |L|$. 

In the case of the OPE coefficients $C^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}(z_1,z_2)$, we have seen that the primary field determines the contributions of its descendant fields. This will also be true in correlation functions, as a result of Virasoro symmetry. However, this would not necessarily hold if we had a larger chiral symmetry algebra such as a W-algebra. 

The form of the dependence on $z_1,z_2$ provides an a posteriori justification for our assumption in Section \ref{sec:hwr} that $L_0$-eigenvalues be bounded from below. We have indeed seen that an $L_0$-eigenvector $LV_\Delta$ of dimension $\Delta+|L|$ comes with a factor $z_{12}^{\Delta+|L|}$. If $L_0$-eigenvalues were not bounded from below, the sum over states could not converge in a neighbourhood of $z_1=z_2$. 


\subsubsection{Fusion rules and fusion products}\label{sec:dope}

The appearance of poles in OPE coefficients is a hint that when degenerate conformal dimensions $(\Delta_{(r,s)})_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ are involved, there are constraints on the fields that can appear in a given OPE. Let us derive these constraints in the simplest case $\Delta_{(1,1)}=0$. There are two types of primary fields of dimension $0$: the non-degenerate field $V_0$, which generates the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_0$, and the degenerate field $V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$, which obeys the null vector equation $L_{-1}V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}=\partial V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}=0$ and generates the degenerate representation $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$. While the OPE $V_0V_{\Delta_2}$ is just a special case of the OPE \eqref{prope}, 
the OPE $V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}V_{\Delta_2}$ also obeys 
\begin{align}
 0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial z_1} V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset C_{\langle 1,1\rangle,\Delta_2}^{\Delta} \frac{\partial}{\partial z_1} z_{12}^{\Delta-\Delta_2} \left(V_\Delta(z_2) +\cdots \right) \ ,
\end{align}
therefore $V_\Delta$ may appear only provided $\Delta=\Delta_2$. This agrees with the remark (in Section \ref{sec:ope}) that $V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$ is proportional to the identity field. 

Then let us study the subtler question of whether $V_0$ or $V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$ may appear in the OPE $V_{\Delta_1}V_{\Delta_2}$. In the case of $V_0$, the pole of $f^{L_{-1}}$ \eqref{fl1} means that our normalization condition $f^1=1$ was wrong: we in fact have $f^1=0$ while $f^{L_{-1}}\neq 0$. Therefore, the non-vanishing null vector $L_{-1}V_0$ may appear in the OPE, together with its descendants, while $V_0$ itself and its other descendants give vanishing contributions. In the case of $V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$ however, the null vector vanishes, and no descendant of $V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}$ may appear --- unless the left-hand side of the OPE Ward identity \eqref{dddv} vanishes, which happens if $\Delta_1=\Delta_2$. 

Let us introduce the \textbf{fusion rules} as a convenient notation for writing constraints on OPEs, by omitting everything but the primary fields:
\begin{align}
 V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle} V_{\Delta} = V_\Delta \quad , \quad V_{\Delta_1} V_{\Delta_2} \ni V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle} \implies \Delta_1=\Delta_2\ . 
\end{align}
This may be reformulated in terms of 
the \textbf{fusion product} of representations of the Virasoro algebra:
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle} \times \mathcal{V}_\Delta = \mathcal{V}_\Delta \quad , \quad \dim\text{Hom}\left(\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_1}\times \mathcal{V}_{\Delta_2}, \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}\right) = \delta_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}\ ,
 \label{rtv}
\end{align}
where $\text{Hom}(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{R}')$ is the space of linear maps from $\mathcal{R}$ to $\mathcal{R}'$ that commute with the action of the Virasoro algebra. 
The fusion product can be algebraically defined \cite{gab99}. It differs from the tensor product, in particular its definition involves the fields' positions, although the resulting product does not. Just like OPEs, the fusion product is commutative and associative. Moreover, as we just saw in the case of Verma modules, we have an isomorphism
\begin{align}
 \text{Hom}\left(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{R}'\right) \simeq \text{Hom}\left(\mathcal{R}\times\mathcal{R}',\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}\right)\ . 
 \label{hrr}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Fusion products of degenerate representations}

Thanks to the isomorphism \eqref{hrr}, we can find the fusion rules of $V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ by studying whether it may appear in an OPE $V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$. This amounts to finding whether the two-dimensional linear system \eqref{el1c}, \eqref{el2c} has a solution, even though it is of rank one. With the help of Eq. \eqref{l1c}, \eqref{l2c}, this condition boils down to 
\begin{align}
 \left(4\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}+2\right) \left(\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}+¨2\Delta_1-\Delta_2\right) = 3\left(\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}+\Delta_1-\Delta_2\right)\left(\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}+1+\Delta_1-\Delta_2\right)\ .
\end{align}
Using the expression \eqref{ars} for $\Delta_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$, and replacing conformal dimensions with momentums \eqref{dp}, this equation reduces to 
\begin{align}
 \prod_{\pm,\pm}\left(\tfrac{\beta}{2}\pm P_1\pm P_2\right) = 0\ . 
\end{align}
This leads to the fusion rules of $V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$, from which the fusion rules of $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ are deduced by $\beta\to \beta^{-1}$. We write these fusion rules in terms of fusion products, where we index Verma modules by their momentums:
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P = \sum_\pm \mathcal{V}_{P\pm \frac{\beta}{2}}} \quad, \quad \boxed{\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P = \sum_\pm \mathcal{V}_{P\pm \frac{1}{2\beta}}}\ . 
 \label{rvvp}
\end{align}
From these simple formulas, all the discrete spectrums of Section \ref{sec:sesc} will follow. For the moment, let us deduce the fusion products of higher degenerate representations $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$, using the associativity of the fusion product. We start with the remark that a highest-weight representation $\mathcal{R}$ is degenerate if and only if its fusion product with any Verma module $\mathcal{R}\times \mathcal{V}_P$ has finitely many terms:
\begin{itemize}
 \item If $\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ is degenerate, the condition that $V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ may appear in the OPE $V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$ leads to polynomial equations of order $rs$ on $\Delta_1,\Delta_2$, just as we saw in the case $(r,s)=(2,1)$. These equations may be interpreted as conditions on residues of OPE coefficients,
 \begin{align}
  V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \supset V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle} \quad \implies \quad \forall L\in \mathcal{L},\ \underset{\Delta=\Delta_{(r,s)}}{\operatorname{Res}} f^{\Delta,L}_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2} = 0\ .
  \label{resf}
 \end{align}
 (If the residues vanish for $|L|=rs$, then they vanish for all $L\in\mathcal{L}$.)
 \item If $\mathcal{R}$ is not degenerate, the corresponding primary field may appear in any OPE of the type $V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2)$, because the OPE Ward identities have a solution. 
\end{itemize}
It follows that a fusion product of degenerate representations is itself a sum of degenerate representations. 
For example, according to Eq. \eqref{rvvp}, the product $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ is the sum of two representations of momentums $\{P_{(2,1)} \pm \frac{\beta}{2}\} = \{P_{(1,1)},P_{(3,1)}\}$. These representations must be degenerate, therefore $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}=\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}+\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 3,1\rangle}$. By associativity of $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P$, we then deduce 
$
 \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 3,1\rangle} \times \mathcal{V}_P = \mathcal{V}_{P-\beta}+\mathcal{V}_P+\mathcal{V}_{P+\beta}
$. Iterating this reasoning over $r$ or $s$, we obtain 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\times \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle} 
 \underset{r\geq 2}{=} \sum_\pm \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r\pm 1,s\rangle} 
 \quad , \quad 
 \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\times \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle} 
 \underset{s\geq 2}{=}\sum_\pm \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\pm 1\rangle} \ .
 \label{rrrs}
\end{align}
This allows us to find the fusion product of any degenerate representation with a Verma module, by iteration over $r$ and $s$:
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P = \sum_{i=-\frac{r-1}{2}}^{\frac{r-1}{2}} \sum_{j=-\frac{s-1}{2}}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} \mathcal{V}_{P+i\beta +j\beta^{-1}}}\ ,
 \label{rrsvp}
\end{align}
where the sums run by increments of $1$. Since this sum has $rs$ terms, the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_{\Delta_{(r,s)}}$ must have a null vector at level $rs$, a result that we admitted in Section \ref{sec:nvvm}, and which we now derived using fusion products. Fusion can even be used to compute the null vectors themselves \cite{fms97}. 

We can then find the fusion product $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle}\times \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}$, either by again iterating over $r_1$ and $s_1$, or by summing the degenerate representations whose momentums appear in both  $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_{P_{(r_2,s_2)}}$ and $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_{P_{(r_1,s_1)}}$:
\begin{align}
  \boxed{\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r_1,s_1 \rangle} \times \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r_2,s_2 \rangle} = \sum_{r\overset{2}{=}|r_1-r_2|+1}^{r_1+r_2-1}\ \sum_{s\overset{2}{=}|s_1-s_2|+1}^{s_1+s_2-1} \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s \rangle}}\ ,
  \label{rrsr}
\end{align}
where the sums now run by increments of $2$. 


\subsection{Correlation functions}\label{sec:cor}

Correlation functions are observables of quantum field theory: quantities that we can in principle compute, and compare with experimental data. We will focus on $N$-point functions on the Riemann sphere: functions of $N$ distinct positions $z_1,z_2,\dots, z_N\in \overline{\mathbb{C}}$, which are written in terms of $N$ fields as 
\begin{align}
 \Big< V_1(z_1) V_2(z_2) \cdots V_N(z_N)\Big>\ . 
\end{align}
Correlation functions are assumed to depend linearly on fields: in particular, this implies $\partial_{z_1}\left<  V_1(z_1) \cdots \right> = \left< \partial_{z_1} V_1(z_1) \cdots \right>$.
All the assumptions and results of Section \ref{sec:fope} may be understood as constraints on correlation functions. 
In two-dimensional CFT, there are other observables that we will not consider, such as: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Correlation functions on higher-genus Riemann surfaces, starting with the torus. 
 \item Correlation functions on Riemann surfaces with boundaries, starting with the disc. 
 \item Correlation functions in the presence of defect lines. 
 \item Entanglement entropy. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conformal symmetry constraints}\label{sec:csc}

In order to derive the conformal symmetry constraints for an $N$-point function of primary fields $Z$, it is convenient to consider the $N+1$-point function $Z(y)$ that also includes the energy-momentum tensor $T(y)$:
\begin{align}
 Z = \left< \prod_{i=1}^N V_{\Delta_i}(z_i)\right> \quad , \quad Z(y) = \left< T(y)\prod_{i=1}^N V_{\Delta_i}(z_i)\right>\ .
\end{align}
The function $Z(y)$ is meromorphic, with $N$ poles at $y=z_i$, where its behaviour is constrained by the OPE $T(y)V_{\Delta_i}(z_i)$ \eqref{tvd}. To fully determine $Z(y)$, it remains to determine its behaviour at $y=\infty$. Because our fields live on the Riemann sphere, they must be smooth at $y=\infty$: in the case of $T(y)$, we assume that this means 
\begin{align}
 T(y) \underset{y\to\infty} = O\left(\frac{1}{y^4}\right)\ .
 \label{tinf}
\end{align}
This implies first of all that $\lim_{y\to \infty} Z(y)=0$, therefore $Z(y)$ is completely determined by its residues at $y=z_i$:
\begin{align}
 Z(y) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac{\Delta_i}{(y-z_i)^2} +\frac{1}{y-z_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}\right) Z\ .
 \label{zy}
\end{align}
Furthermore, Eq. \eqref{tinf} implies the vanishing of the coefficients of $y^{-1},y^{-2},y^{-3}$ in the Laurent expansion of $Z(y)$ near $y=\infty$, leading to the three \textbf{global Ward identitites} 
\begin{align}
 \sum_{i=1}^N \partial_{z_i} Z = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(z_i \partial_{z_i} + \Delta_i\right) Z = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(z_i^2 \partial_{z_i} + 2\Delta_iz_i\right) Z = 0\ .
 \label{gward}
\end{align}
Equivalently, the behaviour of $Z$ under global conformal transformations \eqref{abcd} must be
\begin{align}
 \left< \prod_{i=1}^N  V_{\Delta_i}\left(\frac{az_i+b}{cz_i+d}\right) \right>
 = \prod_{i=1}^N (cz_i +d)^{2\Delta_i} \left< \prod_{i=1}^N V_{\Delta_i}(z_i) \right>\ .
 \label{zgc}
\end{align}
In particular, considering the transformation $z\mapsto \frac{1}{z}$ leads to $V_\Delta(z)\underset{z\to\infty}{=} O(z^{-2\Delta})$, which allows us to define 
\begin{align}
 V_\Delta(\infty) = \lim_{z\to\infty} z^{2\Delta}V_\Delta(z)\ . 
 \label{vdi}
\end{align}
The global Ward identities are valid not only for primary fields, but also for \textbf{global primary fields} (also called quasi-primary fields): $L_0$-eigenvectors that are annihilated by $L_1$ but not necessarily by $L_{n\geq 2}$. According to the OPE $T(y)T(z)$ \eqref{tt}, the energy-momentum tensor is a global primary field of dimension $\Delta=2$, and the resulting behaviour at infinity \eqref{vdi} is consistent with our assumption \eqref{tinf}. 

Let us solve the global Ward identities in the cases $N=1,2,3,4$. We have $3$ linear differential equations in the $N$ variables $z_i$, and we write their solutions up to $z_i$-independent prefactors:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\boxed{N=1}$\ : The identities amount to $\partial_{z_1} Z = \Delta_1 Z=0$, and their solution is 
 \begin{align}
  \left<V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)\right>\propto \delta_{\Delta_1,0}\ . 
 \end{align}
 \item $\boxed{N=2}$\ : Again, there are more Ward identities than variables, leading to $Z\neq 0\implies \Delta_1=\Delta_2$, and to the solution
 \begin{align}
 \Big< V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)V_{\Delta_2}(z_2) \Big> \propto \delta_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2} z_{12}^{-2\Delta_1} \ .
 \label{2pt}
\end{align}
\item $\boxed{N=3}$\ : With as many Ward identities as variables, we have a unique solution with no constraints on the conformal dimensions:
\begin{align}
 \left< \prod_{i=1}^3 V_{\Delta_i}(z_i) \right> \propto z_{12}^{\Delta_3-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} z_{13}^{\Delta_2-\Delta_1-\Delta_3} z_{23}^{\Delta_1-\Delta_2-\Delta_3}\ .
 \label{3pt}
\end{align}
\item $\boxed{N=4}$\ : The solution involves an arbitrary function $G(z)$ of the cross-ratio $z=\frac{z_{12}z_{34}}{z_{13}z_{24}}$:
\begin{align}
 \left< \prod_{i=1}^4 V_{\Delta_i}(z_i) \right> 
 \propto z_{13}^{-2\Delta_1} z_{23}^{\Delta_1-\Delta_2-\Delta_3+\Delta_4} z_{24}^{-\Delta_1-\Delta_2+\Delta_3-\Delta_4} z_{34}^{\Delta_1+\Delta_2-\Delta_3-\Delta_4} G\left(\frac{z_{12}z_{34}}{z_{13}z_{24}}\right)\ .
 \label{4pt}
\end{align}
A four-point function is therefore completely determined by its dependence on $1$ of its $4$ variables. In particular, it can be convenient to set $3$ positions to the fixed values $(z_2,z_3,z_4)=(0,\infty,1)$. Using Eq. \eqref{vdi}, this leads to 
\begin{align}
 \Big< V_{\Delta_1}(z) V_{\Delta_2}(0)V_{\Delta_3}(\infty)V_{\Delta_4}(1) \Big> \propto G(z)\ . 
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
In addition to global Ward identities, there are \textbf{local Ward identities}, which follow from $\oint_\infty dy\ \epsilon(y)Z(y)=0$, where $\epsilon(y)$ is a meromorphic function such that $\epsilon(y)\underset{y\to\infty}{=}O(y^2)$, with poles at $y=z_i$. Local Ward identities allow us to determine correlation functions of descendant fields from the corresponding correlation functions of primary fields, thereby justifying our focus on primary fields. In the case $\epsilon(y) = \frac{1}{(y-z_1)^{n-1}}$ with $n\geq -1$, using the expressions \eqref{zy} for $Z(y)$ and \eqref{lvtv} for $L_{-n}V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)$, we obtain the Ward identity
\begin{align}
 \left<L_{-n}V_{\Delta_1}(z_1)\prod_{j=2}^N V_{\Delta_j}(z_j)\right> = \sum_{j=2}^N \left(-\frac{1}{z_{j1}^{n-1}}\frac{\partial}{\partial z_j} +\frac{n-1}{z_{j1}^n} \Delta_j\right) \left<\prod_{j=1}^N V_{\Delta_j}(z_j)\right>\ . 
 \label{lwi}
\end{align}
If $n\geq 2$ this is a local Ward identity, while for $n=-1,0,1$ we recover global Ward identities. 

\subsubsection{Single-valuedness and chiral factorization}

We assume that correlation functions are single-valued functions on the Riemann sphere. However, correlation functions are of the type of $z^\Delta$, which is multivalued unless $\Delta\in\mathbb{Z}$. Single-valued functions like $|z|^{2\Delta}=z^\Delta\bar{z}^\Delta$ are not written in terms of powers of $z$, but also involve $\bar z$. In the literature, the notation $f(z,\bar z)$ is sometimes used for arbitrary functions of $z$, with $f(z)$ reserved to locally holomorphic functions, i.e. functions such that $\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z} f(z) =0$. We will not use the notation $f(z,\bar z)$, which is redundant since $\bar z$ is itself a function of $z$. 

The generators $\ell_n$ \eqref{lpz} of local conformal transformations are only valid when acting on locally holomorphic functions: for more general functions, the generators are 
\begin{align}
 \ell_n +\bar{\ell}_n \quad , \quad i(\bar\ell_n -\bar \ell_n)\  .
 \label{epbe}
\end{align}
In fact we want the algebra of conformal transformations to act on a complex vector space: the space of complex-valued functions on $\overline{\mathbb{C}}$ for the Witt algebra, the space of states of the CFT for the Virasoro algebra. We should therefore complexify our symmetry algebra, and we obtain two copies of the Virasoro algebra: a \textbf{left-moving or holomorphic} Virasoro algebra $\mathfrak{V}$ with generators $L_n$, and a \textbf{right-moving or antiholomorphic} Virasoro algebra $\bar{\mathfrak{V}}$ with generators $\bar{L}_n$. In the case of the algebra of global conformal transformations, we start with the 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$, with generators \eqref{epbe} with $n=-1,0,1$, and the complexification yields $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})^\mathbb{C} = \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\times \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$.

In Sections \ref{sec:vir} and \ref{sec:fope}, we have been doing \textbf{chiral CFT}, which means considering $\mathfrak{V}$ only. In a full CFT, the symmetry algebra is the \textbf{conformal algebra} $\mathfrak{V}\times \bar{\mathfrak{V}}$, where for simplicity we assume that the left and right central charges are equal. When it comes to representations, Verma modules of $\mathfrak{V}\times \bar{\mathfrak{V}}$ are simply $\mathcal{V}_\Delta\otimes \bar{\mathcal{V}}_{\bar \Delta}$, where we write a bar over representations of $\bar{\mathfrak{V}}$. There are also representations of $\mathfrak{V}\times \bar{\mathfrak{V}}$ that are not themselves factorized. We will encounter such representations in Section \ref{sec:log}. 

Fields now belong to representations of $\mathfrak{V}\times \bar{\mathfrak{V}}$, and they obey $\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z} V(z) = \bar L_{-1} V(z)$, which is the antiholomorphic version of Eq. \eqref{pvlv}. This allows us to define a right-moving energy-momentum tensor $\bar T(y) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \frac{\bar L_n^{(z)}}{(\bar y-\bar z)^{n+2}}$. While $T$ is locally holomorphic, $\bar T$ is locally antiholomorphic:
\begin{align}
 \partial_{\bar z} T(z) = 0 \quad , \quad \partial_z \bar T(z) = 0 \ . 
\end{align}
Let $V_i(z)$ be a field that is primary with respect to the conformal algebra, with the left dimension $\Delta_i$ and the right dimension $\bar\Delta_i$. The difference of these dimensions is called the \textbf{conformal spin}
\begin{align}
 S_i = \Delta_i -\bar\Delta_i\ . 
 \label{sdd} 
\end{align}
In order to write correlation functions, let us define the \textbf{modulus squared notation} 
\begin{align}
 \left| f(\Delta, z)\right|^2 = f(\Delta, z)f(\bar\Delta,\bar z)\ ,
 \label{fdz2}
\end{align}
where $z,\bar z$ are complex conjugates, while $\Delta,\bar\Delta$ are generally not. The solution of the left- and right-moving global Ward identities for 2-point functions is the modulus squared of Eq. \eqref{2pt},
\begin{align}
\boxed{ \Big< V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2) \Big> = B_{12} \left|\delta_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2} z_{12}^{-2\Delta_1}\right|^2} \ ,
\label{2ptb}
\end{align}
where the constant, $z_i$-independent coefficient is now called the \textbf{2-point structure constant} $B_{12}$. Similarly, 3-point functions are given by the modulus squared of Eq. \eqref{3pt},
\begin{align}
 \boxed{  \Big< V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2)V_3(z_3) \Big> = C_{123} \left|z_{12}^{\Delta_3-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} z_{13}^{\Delta_2-\Delta_1-\Delta_3} z_{23}^{\Delta_1-\Delta_2-\Delta_3}\right|^2 }\ ,
 \label{3ptc}
\end{align}
where $C_{123}$ is the \textbf{3-point structure constant}. Single-valuedness of the 2-point and 3-point functions implies that spins obey
\begin{align}
 S_i\in\frac12 \mathbb{Z} \quad , \quad S_1+S_2+S_3 \in\mathbb{Z}\ . 
 \label{sihz}
\end{align}
Now we have assumed that fields commute \eqref{comm}, but the $z_i$-dependent factors of the 2-point and 3-point functions are not invariant under permutations. This implies that structure constants behave as
\begin{align}
 B_{21} = (-)^{2S_1} B_{12} \quad ,\quad C_{\sigma(1)\sigma(2)\sigma(3)} = \text{sign}(\sigma)^{S_1+S_2+S_3} C_{123}\ , 
 \label{b21}
\end{align}
where $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\{1,2,3\}$. In particular, for the 2-point function of a field with itself, we have $B_{12}=B_{21}$, which must vanish if the spin is half-integer $S_1\in \frac12+\mathbb{Z}$. Fields with half-integer spins should rather anti-commute with themselves, i.e. they should be fermionic. 
Unless stated otherwise, we will assume that spins are integer:
\begin{align}
 \boxed{S\in \mathbb{Z}}\ .
 \label{siz}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Crossing symmetry and conformal blocks}

Let us systematically use OPEs for simplifying correlation functions. Knowing the contribution \eqref{prope} of left-moving descendants of primary fields, the complete OPE of two primary fields reads 
\begin{align}
 V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2) = \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}} C_{12}^k \left|z_{12}^{\Delta_k-\Delta_1-\Delta_2}\sum_{L\in\mathcal{L}} z_{12}^{|L|}f_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta_k,L}\right|^2 V_k(z_2)\ ,
 \label{tope}
\end{align}
where the basis $\mathcal{L}$ of creation operators was defined in Eq. \eqref{lcm},
we assume that all fields are primaries or descendants thereof, with $\mathcal{S}$ a basis of primaries. Let us insert this OPE in a three-point function, and focus on the leading terms as $z_1\to z_2$. Using the 2-point function \eqref{2ptb}, we obtain
\begin{align}
  \Big< V_1(z_1)V_2(z_2)V_3(z_3) \Big> \underset{z_1\to z_2}{\sim} 
  \left|z_{12}^{\Delta_3-\Delta_1-\Delta_2}z_{23}^{-2\Delta_3}\right|^2 
  \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}\left|\substack{\Delta_3=\Delta_k\\ \bar{\Delta}_3=\bar\Delta_k}\right. }
  C_{12}^k B_{k3}\ .
\end{align}
Comparing with the 3-point function \eqref{3ptc}, this implies a relation between the 2-point, 3-point and OPE structure constants, 
\begin{align}
 C_{123} = \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}\left|\substack{\Delta_3=\Delta_k\\ \bar{\Delta}_3=\bar\Delta_k}\right. } C_{12}^k B_{k3}\ .
\end{align}
If the basis of fields is such that $B_{ij}=\delta_{ij}B_i$, and in particular if two different primary fields never share the same conformal dimensions, the sum over $k$ reduces to one term, and the relation reduces to
\begin{align}
 \boxed{C_{123} = C_{12}^3B_{3}} \ .
 \label{ccb}
\end{align}

Inserting the OPE in the four-point function $\left<V_1(z)V_2(0)V_3(\infty)V_4(1)\right>$, we obtain a linear combination of 3-point functions of the type $\left<L\bar{L}V_k(0) V_3(\infty)V_4(1)\right>$ with $L,\bar L\in\mathcal{L}$. Deducing 3-point functions of descendants from 3-point functions of primaries using local Ward identities, we can in principle compute the ratios
\begin{align}
 g^L_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\Delta_3} = \frac{\left< LV_{\Delta_1}(0) V_{\Delta_2}(\infty)V_{\Delta_3}(1)\right>}{\left< V_{\Delta_1}(0) V_{\Delta_2}(\infty)V_{\Delta_3}(1)\right>}\ .
\end{align}
This allows us to write our 4-point function as 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\Big<V_1(z)V_2(0)V_3(\infty)V_4(1)\Big> = \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}} C_{12}^k C_{k34} \left|\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_{\Delta_k}\left(c\middle|\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\Delta_3,\Delta_4\middle|z\right)\right|^2}  \ ,
 \label{sdec}
\end{align}
where we introduce the \textbf{$s$-channel Virasoro blocks}, which are known (in principle) functions of $z$ as well as the central charge and conformal dimensions:
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{F}_{\Delta}^{(s)}\left(c\middle|\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\Delta_3,\Delta_4\middle|z\right) = z^{\Delta-\Delta_1-\Delta_2}\sum_{L\in\mathcal{L}} z^{|L|} f_{\Delta_1,\Delta_2}^{\Delta,L}g^L_{\Delta,\Delta_3,\Delta_4}\ ,
 \label{fsl}
\end{align}
The $s$-channel decomposition \eqref{sdec} reduces the 4-point function to a combination of model-dependent structure constants, and universal Virasoro blocks. Repeatedly using OPEs, any $N$-point function can likewise be decomposed into $N$-point Virasoro blocks. However, these decompositions are not unique. In the case $N=4$, there are 3 possible decompositions, called the \textbf{$s$-channel}, \textbf{$t$-channel} and \textbf{$u$-channel} decompositions, depending on which OPE we perform. For each channel, let us write the relevant OPE, the \textbf{4-point structure constants} that appear as coefficients, the asymptotics of the Virasoro blocks, and a diagram that represents the decomposition:
\begin{align}
 \begin{array}{|r||c|c|c|}
  \hline 
  \text{Channel} & s & t & u
  \\ \hline
  \text{OPE} & V_1(z)V_2(0) & V_1(z)V_4(1) & V_1(z)V_3(\infty)
  \\ \hline 
  \text{4-point} & D^{(s)}_k = C_{12}^k C_{k34} & D^{(t)}_k = C_{41}^k C_{k23} & D^{(u)}_k = C_{13}^k C_{k42}
\\ \hline 
  \text{Asymptotics} & \mathcal{F}^{(s)}_{\Delta}\underset{z\to 0}{\sim} z^{\Delta-\Delta_1-\Delta_2} & \mathcal{F}^{(t)}_{\Delta}\underset{z\to 1}{\sim} (1-z)^{\Delta-\Delta_1-\Delta_4}
  & \mathcal{F}^{(u)}_\Delta  \underset{z\to \infty}{\sim} \left(\tfrac{1}{z}\right)^{\Delta+\Delta_1-\Delta_3}
  \\
  \hline 
\text{Diagram} & 
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(current  bounding  box.center), very thick, scale = .3]
\draw (-1,2) node [left] {$2$} -- (0,0) -- node [above] {$k$} (4,0) -- (5,2) node [right] {$3$};
\draw (-1,-2) node [left] {$1$} -- (0,0);
\draw (4,0) -- (5,-2) node [right] {$4$};
\end{tikzpicture}
& 
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(current  bounding  box.center), very thick, scale = .3]
 \draw (-2,3) node [left] {$2$} -- (0,2) -- node [left] {$k$} (0,-2) -- (-2, -3) node [left] {$1$};
\draw (0,2) -- (2,3) node [right] {$3$};
\draw (0,-2) -- (2, -3) node [right] {$4$};
\end{tikzpicture}
& 
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(current  bounding  box.center), very thick, scale = .3]
\draw (-2,1) node [left] {$2$} -- (0,0) -- node [left] {$k$} (0,-4) ;
\draw (0,0)-- (2,-5) node [right] {$4$};
\draw (-2,-5) node [left] {$1$} -- (0,-4);
\draw (0,-4) -- (2,1) node [right] {$3$};
\end{tikzpicture} 
  \\
  \hline 
 \end{array}
 \label{stu}
\end{align}
In order to write these decompositions in greater generality, let us define the $x$-channel \textbf{conformal blocks} as 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{G}^{(x)}_{\Delta_k} = \left|\mathcal{F}_{\Delta_k}^{(x)}\right|^2\ , \qquad (x=s,t,u)\ . 
 \label{gf2}
\end{align}
Our conformal blocks are chirally factorized into Virasoro blocks because of our assumption that all fields are primaries or descendants. However, representations of the conformal algebra that are not factorized give rise to blocks that are also not factorized: this is the case with the logarithmic representations of Section \ref{sec:log}. We now write the \textbf{crossing symmetry equations} as the equality between the 3 decompositions of a four-point function into structure constants and conformal blocks:
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}} D_k^{(s)} \mathcal{G}^{(s)}_{\Delta_k} = \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}} D_k^{(t)} \mathcal{G}^{(t)}_{\Delta_k} = \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}} D_k^{(u)} \mathcal{G}^{(u)}_{\Delta_k}} \ . 
\end{align}
Given 4 fields $V_1,V_2,V_3,V_4$, this is a system of infinitely many equations (parametrized by the cross-ratio $z$) for the spectrum $\mathcal{S}$ and the 4-point structure constants $D_k^{(x)}$. The difficulty of solving these equations depends on what we know (or assume) on these objects. Let us discuss 3 scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item We know the \textbf{CFT data}: the spectrm $\mathcal{S}$ and the 2-point and 3-point structure constants $B,C$. This determines the OPEs. Crossing symmetry of arbitrary 4-point functions is equivalent to the associativity of the OPE, and therefore to the consistency of the CFT on the sphere. In this scenario, we do not solve the crossing symmetry equations, but only check that they are obeyed by a given solution.
 \item We know the spectrum but not the structure constants. Using the factorization of 4-point structure constants into 3-point structure constants (see Table \eqref{stu}), crossing symmetry is a system of nonlinear equations for the 3-point structure constants.
 \item We know the conformal dimensions that appear in the spectrum, but not how many fields of a given dimensions exist. Then crossing symmetry is a system of linear equations for the 4-point structure constants, viewed as functions of conformal dimensions. But we cannot distinguish two fields with the same dimension, or factorize 4-point structure constants into 3-point structure constants. 
\end{enumerate}
We will encounter Scenario 1 in Liouville theory, and Scenario 3 in loop models.


\section{Sketching exactly solvable CFTs}\label{sec:sesc}

In this section we derive the spectrums and fusion rules of exactly solvable CFTs. We begin with a general discussion of CFTs, their spectrums, and the consequences of having degenerate fields. Historically, the CFTs we will discuss have been discovered using a variety of techniques: the modular bootstrap for minimal models \cite{fms97}, the Lagrangian approach for Liouville theory with $c\geq 25$ \cite{zz95}, lattice constructions for the $O(n)$ and Potts models \cite{fsz87}, the numerical bootstrap for Liouville theory with $c\leq 1$ \cite{rs15}. Here we recover their spectrums from assumptions about Virasoro representations and their fusion rules. Although our assumptions are simple, they are not unique or inevitable, and it can be interesting to relax or modify them. These assumptions could also be useful for exploring CFTs with extended symmetry algebras. 

\subsection{Spectrum and degenerate fields}

\subsubsection{What is a CFT? What is a spectrum?}

We define a \textbf{conformal field theory} as a set of correlation functions that obey the assumptions of Section \ref{sec:bo}, most importantly Virasoro symmetry, the commutativity of fields, the existence of OPEs, and single-valuedness. We already know that on the sphere, a conformal field theory is characterized by a spectrum and 2-point and 3-point structure constants such that crossing symmetry is obeyed.

This definition works very well in \textbf{rational CFTs}, i.e. CFTs whose spectrums are made of finitely many primary fields and their descendants. However, in more general CFTs, the notion of the spectrum becomes fuzzy. To say why, let us introduce various spectrums associated to various objects. By an abuse of terminology, we call spectrum a basis of primary fields: 
\begin{align}
 \begin{array}{|c|c|l|}
  \hline 
  \text{Object} & \text{Spectrum}  & \text{Definition or constraint}
  \\
  \hline \hline 
  V_1V_2 & \text{OPE spectrum } \mathcal{S}_{12} & V_1V_2 \sim \sum_{k\in \mathcal{S}_{12}} V_k 
  \\
  \hline 
  \left<V_1V_2V_3V_4\right> & \text{Channel spectrum } \mathcal{S}^{(s)} &  \mathcal{S}^{(s)}= \mathcal{S}_{12}\cap \mathcal{S}_{34}
  \\
  \hline 
  \text{CFT} & \text{Physical spectrum } \mathcal{S} &  i,j\in\mathcal{S}\implies \mathcal{S}_{i,j}\subset \mathcal{S}  
  \\
  \hline 
  \widetilde{\text{CFT}} & \text{Extended spectrum } \widetilde{\mathcal{S}} & \mathcal{S}\subset \widetilde{\mathcal{S}}\ , \quad i,j\in\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}\implies \mathcal{S}_{i,j}\subset \widetilde{\mathcal{S}}
  \\
  \hline 
 \end{array}
 \label{specs}
\end{align}
The \textbf{physical spectrum} is made of the fields whose correlation functions we are interested in. Our constraint on the physical spectrum is called \textbf{closure under OPEs}. This constraint means that if a field appears in an OPE (or a fortiori in a channel spectrum), then its correlation functions exist. 
We also introduce \textbf{extended spectrums} as larger spectrums that are also closed under OPEs. There are various reasons for considering extended spectrums:
\begin{itemize}
 \item In Section \ref{sec:csc}, we have used the energy-momentum tensor $T$ for deriving Ward identities. However, in Liouville theory, $T$ does not belong to the physical spectrum. Nevertheless, it always makes sense to insert $T$ in correlation functions, because it is a descendant of the identity field. 
 \item In the $O(n)$ model and in Liouville theory, we will use the degenerate field $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ for constraining correlation functions, even though it does not belong to the physical spectrum. Correlation functions that involve $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ are not single-valued: they belong to an extended CFT that obeys weaker assumptions. 
 \item The spectrum of Liouville theory is continuous, so that the OPE gives rise to an integral over the real momentums of primary fields. Since the integrand is meromorphic, the integration contour can be deformed in the complex plane. This leads to an extended spectrum of complex momentums. 
\end{itemize}
We will say that \textbf{a field exists} if it belongs to some extended spectrum, i.e. if it can be consistently added to our CFT. 

\subsubsection{Diagonal and non-diagonal fields}

Motivated by the single-valuedness of correlation functions, we have made the assumption \eqref{siz} that conformal spins are integer. In extended spectrums, we may relax this assumption to the half-integer spin condition \eqref{sihz}:
\begin{align}
 i\in\mathcal{S}\implies S_i\in\mathbb{Z} \quad , \quad i \in \widetilde{\mathcal{S}}\implies S_i\in\frac12\mathbb{Z}\ . 
\end{align}
A simple way to satisfy these assumptions is to have fields of spin zero, i.e. \textbf{spinless fields}. However, whenever degenerate fields exist, we will use the slightly different notion of a \textbf{diagonal field}: a spinless field whose OPEs with degenerate fields only produces spinless fields. Conversely, a \textbf{non-diagonal field} is a field that either has nonzero spin, or is related to fields with nonzero spins by taking OPEs with degenerate fields. A \textbf{diagonal CFT} is a CFT whose spectrum only involves diagonal fields.  

Let us summarize the primary fields that we will consider, together with their conformal dimensions, and the representations of the conformal algebra that they generate. 
\begin{align}
 \begin{array}{|r|l|l|l|l|}
  \hline 
  \text{Name} & \text{Notation} & \text{Conditions} & (\Delta,\bar \Delta) & \text{Representation}
  \\
  \hline \hline 
  \text{Degenerate} &  V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle} &  r,s\in\mathbb{N}^* & \left(\Delta_{(r,s)},\Delta_{(r,s)}\right)  & \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}\otimes \bar{\mathcal{R}}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle} 
  \\
  \hline 
  \text{Fully degenerate} & V^f_{\langle r,s\rangle} & \begin{array}{l} r,s\in\mathbb{N}^* \\ \beta^2\in\mathbb{Q} \end{array} & \left(\Delta_{(r,s)},\Delta_{(r,s)}\right)  & \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}\otimes \bar{\mathcal{R}}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle} 
  \\
  \hline 
  \text{Diagonal} & V_P & P\in\mathbb{C} & \left(\tfrac{c-1}{24}+P^2,\tfrac{c-1}{24}+P^2\right) & \mathcal{V}_P\otimes \bar{\mathcal{V}}_P

  \hline 
  \text{Non-diagonal} & V_{(r,s)} & 
  \begin{array}{l} r,s\in\mathbb{C} \\ 
  rs\in \tfrac12\mathbb{Z} \end{array} & \left(\Delta_{(r,s)},\Delta_{(r,-s)}\right) & 
  \begin{array}{l} \mathcal{V}_{P_{(r,s)}} \otimes \bar{\mathcal{V}}_{P_{(r,-s)}} \\ \text{(in general)} \end{array}
  \\
  \hline 
 \end{array}
 \label{fields}
\end{align}
We parametrize non-diagonal primary fiels $V_{(r,s)}$ using the Kac indices defined by Eq. \eqref{prs}, instead of the left and right dimensions. 
According to Eq. \eqref{drms}, the conformal spin of $V_{(r,s)}$ is 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{S_{(r,s)}= rs} \ . 
 \label{srs}
\end{align}
Then $V_{(r,s)}$ generates the Verma module $\mathcal{V}_{P_{(r,s)}} \otimes \bar{\mathcal{V}}_{P_{(r,-s)}}$, unless that module has null vectors, which occurs if $r,s\in\mathbb{Z}^*$, and also for other values of $r,s$ if $\beta^2\in\mathbb{Q}$. If there are null vectors, $V_{(r,s)}$ may generate a degenerate representation, or belong to a logarithmic representation. We will discuss such cases as they arise.  

\subsubsection{How many degenerate fields?}\label{sec:hmdf}

In general, OPEs of degenerate fields produce more degenerate fields. We assume that the sets of degenerate fields in $\mathcal{S}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}$ are closed under the fusion rules \eqref{rrsr}. If for example we repeatedly fuse $V^d_{\langle 5,2\rangle}$ with itself, we obtain all $V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ with $(r,s)\in (2\mathbb{N}+1)\times \mathbb{N}^*$. For each one of the two Kac indices $r,s$, allowing one even value implies allowing all values in $\mathbb{N}^*$, and allowing one odd value except $1$ implies allowing all odd values. Modulo $r\leftrightarrow s$, this leads to 7 possible sets of degenerate fields, which we characterize by whether or not they contain $V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}, V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle},V^d_{\langle 3,1\rangle},V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ and $V^d_{\langle 1,3\rangle}$:
\begin{align}
 %\begin{array}{c}
  \emptyset \quad \left\{V^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle}\right\}  \quad \left\{V^d_{\langle 1,3\rangle}\right\} \quad \left\{V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\right\} 
  % \\
  \quad 
  \left\{V^d_{\langle 3,1\rangle},V^d_{\langle 1,3\rangle}\right\} \quad 
  \left\{V^d_{\langle 3,1\rangle},V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\right\} \quad 
  \left\{V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle},V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\right\} 
 %\end{array}
 \label{degsets}
\end{align}
In particular, the set that is generated by $\{V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle},V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\} $ is the full set of degenerate fields $\{V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}\}_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$. 
In order to solve CFTs, the existence of degenerate fields matters much more than their presence in the spectrum. We will focus on two types of CFTs:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{CFTs with 2 degenerate fields}, in the sense that both $V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ and $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ exist. 
 \item \textbf{CFTs with 1 degenerate field} $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$. Because the invariance under $\beta\to \beta^{-1}$ is broken by choosing $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ rather than $V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$, such CFTs depend on $\beta^2$ \eqref{cb} rather than on the central charge $c$. 
\end{itemize}
For $\beta^2\in\mathbb{Q}$, we have to distinguish fully degenerate fields from partly degenerate fields. And the fully degenerate fields $V^f_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ and $V^f_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ are not independent, as follows from the identities
\begin{align}
 \beta^2 =\frac{q}{p}>0 \implies V^f_{\langle p-1,1\rangle} = V^f_{\langle 1,q-1\rangle} \quad , \quad  \beta^2 =-\frac{q}{p}<0 \implies V^f_{\langle p+1,1\rangle} = V^f_{\langle 1,q+1\rangle}\ . 
\end{align}
Degenerate fields are so important that it has been proposed to formally extend the conformal algebra into an \textbf{interchiral algebra}, which also includes the degenerate fields \cite{grs12}. While we will not systematically use this concept, we will find it convenient to introduce interchiral conformal blocks in Section \ref{sec:icb}. 

\subsubsection{Degenerate OPEs and their consequences}

The OPE of $V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ or $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ with a given primary field is constrained by the fusion rules \eqref{rvvp}, which allow 2 left-moving momentums and 2 right-moving momentums, for a total of 4 representations.  In the case of a diagonal field $V_P$, the requirement that only spinless primary fields appear single out 2 of the 4 possibilities:
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle} V_P \sim \sum_\pm V_{P\pm\frac{\beta}{2}}} \quad , \quad \boxed{V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle} V_P \sim \sum_\pm V_{P\pm\frac{1}{2\beta}}} \ . 
 \label{vpope}
\end{align}
In the case of a non-diagonal field $V_{(r,s)}$, the 4 fields that can a priori appear are
\begin{align}
 V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}V_{(r,s)} &\subset \sum_\pm V_{(r\pm 1,s)} + \sum_\pm V_{(r,s\pm \beta^2)}\ ,
 \label{vtovrs}
 \\
 V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}V_{(r,s)} &\subset \sum_\pm V_{(r\pm \beta^{-2},s)} + \sum_\pm V_{(r,s\pm 1)}\ .
 \label{votvrs}
\end{align}
Since all fields have half-integer spins, the following spin differences must also be half-integer whenever the corresponding fields exist: 
\begin{align}
 S_{(r\pm 1,s)} - S_{(r,s)} = \pm s &\quad , \quad S_{(r,s\pm \beta^2)} - S_{(r,s)} = \pm r\beta^2\ ,
 \label{sdiff1}
 \\
 S_{(r\pm \beta^{-2},s)} - S_{(r,s)} = \pm s\beta^{-2} &\quad , \quad S_{(r,s\pm 1)} - S_{(r,s)} = \pm r\ . 
 \label{sdiff2}
\end{align}
We now assume that $\beta^2\notin \mathbb{Q}$, and remember $rs\in\frac12\mathbb{Z}$. It follows that $V_{(r\pm 1,s)}$ and $V_{(r,s\pm 1)}$ can coexist neither with $V_{(r,s\pm \beta^2)}$ nor with $V_{(r\pm \beta^{-2},s)}$. Therefore, the OPEs $V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}V_{(r,s)}$ and $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}V_{(r,s)}$ each contain at most two primary fields, out of the four that are allowed by fusion rules. For notational simplicity, we choose these two primary fields as follows: 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}V_{(r,s)} \sim \sum_\pm V_{(r\pm 1,s)}} \quad ,\quad
 \boxed{V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}V_{(r,s)} \sim \sum_\pm V_{(r,s\pm 1)}}\ . 
 \label{vdvrs}
\end{align}
While they were derived under the assumption $\beta^2\notin \mathbb{Q}$, we will assume that these OPEs are valid for any value of the central charge. 

The OPEs \eqref{vdvrs} and \eqref{vpope} indicate which primary fields can appear: we now assume that in each one of these OPEs, the two fields that can appear do appear. 
Together with the closure of the spectrum under OPEs, this leads to constraints on non-diagonal fields. If indeed $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\in\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}$, then $V_{(r,s)}\in\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}\implies V_{(r,s\pm 1)}\in\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}$. 
 Requiring that the conformal spin \eqref{srs} remains half-integer under $s\to s\pm 1$, we obtain
 $r\in \frac12 \mathbb{Z}$ 
Moreover, let us  consider the correlation function $\left<V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\prod_{i=1}^NV_{(r_i,s_i)}\right>$. 
The monodromy of $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$  around $V_{(r_i,s_i)}$ is $e^{2\pi ir_i}\in \{1,-1\}$, as determined by the OPE \eqref{prope} and the differences of spins \eqref{sdiff2}. Each one of these monodromies may be nontrivial, but their product must be $1$. Therefore, 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}\in\widetilde{\mathcal{S}} \quad \implies\quad  r\in \frac12\mathbb{Z} \quad , \quad \sum_{i=1}^N r_i  \in \mathbb{Z}}\ . 
 \label{sriz}
\end{align}
Similarly, the existence of $V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ leads to constraints on the second Kac index of non-diagonal fields $V_{(r,s)}$,
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}\in\widetilde{\mathcal{S}} \quad \implies\quad  s\in \frac12\mathbb{Z} \quad , \quad \sum_{i=1}^N s_i  \in \mathbb{Z}}\ . 
 \label{ssiz}
\end{align}
Finally, a necessary condition for an OPE $V_1V_2\sim \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}_{12}}V_k$ \eqref{tope} to converge is that the total conformal dimension be bounded from below over the OPE spectrum $\mathcal{S}_{12}$,
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\inf_{k\in \mathcal{S}_{12}}\left(\Delta_k+\bar\Delta_k\right) > -\infty} \ . 
 \label{iddb}
\end{align}
The total conformal dimension of a non-diagonal field $V_{(r,s)}$ is 
\begin{align}
 \Delta_{(r,s)}+\Delta_{(r,-s)} = \frac12\left[ r^2\beta^{2} + s^2\beta^{-2}  -\left(\beta-\beta^{-1}\right)^2\right]\ .
\end{align}
If $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ exists, then the OPE \eqref{vdvrs} increments $s$ by one unit, therefore $s$ is unbounded in real part i.e. $\sup_{V_{(r,s)}\in \widetilde{\mathcal{S}}} \left(\Re s\right) = \infty$. Assuming that this holdes not only for the extended spectrum $\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}$ but also for some OPE spectrum $\mathcal{S}_{12}$, we deduce $\Re\beta^{-2}>0$, or equivalently 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\Re\beta^2 > 0 \quad \text{i.e.} \quad \Re c < 13}\ .
 \label{rbp}
\end{align}
This constraint holds for all known non-diagonal CFTs with at least 1 degenerate field. 

\subsection{Diagonal CFTs with 2 degenerate fields}\label{sec:diag}

\subsubsection{Generalized minimal models}\label{sec:gmm}

For $\beta^2\in\mathbb{C}^*-\mathbb{Q}$, we define the \textbf{generalized minimal model (GMM)} as the CFT whose spectrum of primary fields is made of all diagonal degenerate fields:
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\mathcal{S}^\text{GMM} = \left\{ V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}\right\}_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}} \ . 
\end{align}
The set of conformal dimensions is in general not bounded from below:
\begin{align}
 \inf_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}\left(\Re\Delta_{(r,s)}\right) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \frac{c-1}{24} &\text{ if } \beta^2 \in \mathbb{R}^*\ , \\ -\infty & \text{ else }. \end{array}\right. 
\end{align}
However, thanks to the degenerate fusion rules \eqref{rrsr}, any OPE spectrum is finite, and therefore respects the convergence condition \eqref{iddb}.

For $\beta^2\in \mathbb{Q}$, as we will see in Section \ref{sec:amm}, there exist A-series minimal models, whose spectrums contain finitely many diagonal degenerate fields. There may well exist other CFTs whose primary fields are diagonal and (partly or fully) degenerate. One way to explore this issue is to take limits of GMM correlation functions as $\beta^2\to \beta^2_0\in \mathbb{Q}$. This can give rise to logarithmic correlation functions \cite{rib18}, suggesting the appearance of logarithmic representations of the conformal algebra. 

Generalized minimal models exist only on the sphere. In particular, their torus partition functions are infinite: if $\beta^2\in\mathbb{C}-\mathbb{R}$, this is because $\left\{ \Delta_{(r,s)}\right\}_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ is not bounded from below. Nevertheless, GMMs are interesting because they are very simple and natural CFTs, which give rise to various other CFTs in certain limits --- starting with Liouville theory.

\subsubsection{Liouville theory}\label{sec:liou}

Let us consider the spectrum of a generalized minimal model with $\beta^2\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}-\mathbb{Q}$. The momentums $P_{(r,s)}$ \eqref{prs} are dense in the real line, i.e. $\overline{\left\{ P_{(r,s)}\right\}_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*}} = \mathbb{R}$. Any diagonal field with a real momentum can therefore be obtained as a limit of degenerate fields,
\begin{align}
 \forall P\in\mathbb{R}\ , \quad V_P = \lim_{\substack{r,s\to\infty \\ P_{(r,s)}\to P}} V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}\ .
 \label{vplim}
\end{align}
We assume that the resulting fields are only characterized by their conformal dimensions. This implies that $V_P$ does not depend on how exactly we take the limit, and also that $V_P=V_{-P}$. The study of correlation functions in Section \ref{sec:dfpf} will justify this assumption.

If we apply the limit to both fields in the OPE $V^d_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle}V^d_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}$, the resulting OPE is formally given by the degenerate fusion rules \eqref{rrsr} with $r_1,s_1,r_2,s_2\to\infty$, and we obtain
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V_{P_1}V_{P_2} \sim \frac12 \int_\mathbb{R} dP\ V_P} \ ,
 \label{idpv}
\end{align}
where the factor $\frac12$ is because $V_P=V_{-P}$. Now, remember from Section \ref{sec:csope} that OPE coefficients have poles when the momentum $P$ becomes degenerate, and these poles are dense in the real line. The integral in the OPE $V_{P_1}V_{P_2}$ is therefore formally divergent. But it can be regularized by shifting the integration line into the complex plane:
\begin{align}
 V_{P_1}V_{P_2} \sim \frac12 \int_{\mathbb{R}+i\epsilon} dP\ V_P\ .
 \label{ireg}
\end{align}
Let us call \textbf{Liouville theory} the resulting CFT. The spectrum of primary fields is formally
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\mathcal{S}^\text{Liouville} = \frac12 \left\{ V_P\right\}_{P\in \mathbb{R}}}\ .
 \label{sliou}
\end{align}
The regularized OPE \eqref{ireg} requires that we extend the spectrum to complex momentums. This will turn out to be possible, because correlation functions are analytic in $P$. 

For the moment, we have defined Liouville theory for $\beta^2\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}-\mathbb{Q}$. By taking limits, we can extend it to the half-line $c\leq 1$ i.e. $\beta^2\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. But we cannot do an analytically continuation the rest of the complex $c$-plane, because of the poles of OPE coefficients. These poles lie on the real $P$-line if $c\leq 1$, but as soon as $c$ strays from this half-line, the poles spread out in the complex $P$-plane, and cross the integration line $\mathbb{R}+i\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$. In the following figures, we draw the regions where poles are found in blue, and the poles $\pm P_{(1,1)}$ as blue circles; the integration line is in red: 
\begin{align}
 \newcommand{\polewedge}[3]{

 \end{tikzpicture}
 \vspace{3mm}
 \\
\beta^2>0 & \beta^2\in\mathbb{C}-\mathbb{R} & \beta^2<0
\end{array}
\end{align}
We nevertheless define Liouville theory for $c\in\mathbb{C}-(-\infty,1]$ by the spectrum \eqref{sliou} and OPE \eqref{idpv}, where we no longer need to shift the integration line. 
We also assume that correlation functions are analytic in momentums and in the central charge, and that degenerate fields exist, so that we have the extended spectrum
\begin{align}
 \boxed{ \widetilde{\mathcal{S}}^\text{Liouville} = \frac12 \left\{ V_P\right\}_{P\in \mathbb{C}} \cup \left\{ V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}\right\}_{r,s\in\mathbb{N}^*} }\ .
 \label{stliou}
\end{align}
The resulting extended CFT therefore includes a generalized minimal model. 


\subsubsection{A-series minimal models}\label{sec:amm}

Let us look for rational, diagonal CFTs. 
To any degenerate representation of the Virasoro algebra, we can associate a diagonal primary field. We conjecture that this leads to a bijection 
\begin{align}
\begin{array}{c}
 \text{Finite sets of degenerate representations that are closed under fusion}
 \\
 \iff 
 \\
 \text{Rational, diagonal CFTs on the sphere}
\end{array}
\end{align}
To the best of our knowledge, there is no known counterexample to this conjecture (and no proof either). 
From the fusion rules \eqref{rrsr}, no nontrivial finite set of simply degenerate representations can be closed under fusion. We therefore need multiply degenerate representations, which implies $\beta^2\in\mathbb{Q}$.  

In the case $\beta^2=-\frac{q}{p}<0$, with $p,q\in\mathbb{N}^*$ coprime, there are no finite sets of degenerate representations that are closed under fusion. To look for such sets, we could focus on the simplest doubly degenerate representation, 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle p+1,1\rangle}=\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle 1,q+1\rangle}\ .
\end{align}
The degenerate fusion rules predict  
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle p+1,1\rangle}\times \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle p+1,1\rangle} = \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle 1,1\rangle} + \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle 2p+1,1\rangle}\ .
 \label{rfppo}
\end{align}
The fully degenerate nature of $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle 2p+1,1\rangle}$ follows from the associativity of $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle p+1,1\rangle}\times \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle p+1,1\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P$, and from the fusion product
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle p+1,1\rangle} \times \mathcal{V}_P = \sum_{\pm} \mathcal{V}_{P\pm \frac12\sqrt{pq}}\ ,
\end{align}
which follows from Eq. \eqref{rrsvp}, with $\{P\pm \frac12\sqrt{pq}\}_\pm = \{P+i\beta\}_{i=-\frac{p}{2},\cdots, \frac{p}{2}} \cap \{P+j\beta\}_{j=-\frac{q}{2},\cdots, \frac{q}{2}}$. 
The two resulting representations in Eq. \eqref{rfppo} have dimensions that differ by an integer, so they might in fact be combined into a single logarithmic representation, see Section \ref{sec:log}. The point is that by repeatedly fusing $V^f_{\langle p+1,1\rangle}$ with itself, we can obtain primary states of dimensions $\Delta_{(r,1)}$ with no bound on $r$. 

We therefore focus on the case $\beta^2 = \frac{q}{p}>0$ with $p,q\in\mathbb{N}^*$ coprime. For simplicity, we will only study the representations that are generated by $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ and $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$. This is enough for recovering the known A-series minimal models, but not for investigating other diagonal, rational CFTs that might exist on the sphere. 
Let us show that $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle 2,1\rangle}$ and $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ generate the representations $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}$  whose indices belong to the \textbf{Kac table} 
\begin{align}
 (r, s) \in [1, p-1] \times [1, q-1] \ .
 \label{kac}
\end{align}
This amounts to showing that $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} \times \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}$ only involves representations with indices in the Kac table, and that these representations are fully degenerate. Using the vanishing null vectors of doubly degenerate representations of the type 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle} = \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle p-r,q-s\rangle}\ , 
 \label{prqs}
\end{align}
we obtain constraints on the fusion rules \eqref{rrsr}
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} \times \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle} &\subset \sum_{r\overset{2}{=} |r_1-r_2|+1}^{r_1+r_2-1}\sum_{s\overset{2}{=} |s_1-s_2|+1}^{s_1+s_2-1} \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle} \ , 
 \\
 \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} \times \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle} &\subset \sum_{r'\overset{2}{=} |r_1-r_2|+1}^{2p-r_1-r_2-1} \sum_{s'\overset{2}{=} |s_1-s_2|+1}^{2q-s_1-s_2-1}\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r',s'\rangle} \ , 
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ is a representation that may or may not be fully degenerate. Now, $\mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r,s\rangle} = \mathcal{R}^d_{\langle r',s'\rangle}$ implies $(r,s)=(r',s')$ or $(r,s)=(p-r',q-s')$, but the second equality is impossible due to parity: since $p$ and $q$ are coprime, one of them must be odd, say $p$, but $r\equiv r'\equiv |r_1-r_2|+1\bmod 2$. We therefore obtain the fusion rules 
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} \times \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle} = \sum_{r\overset{2}{=} |r_1-r_2|+1}^{\min(r_1+r_2,2p-r_1-r_2)-1}\sum_{s\overset{2}{=} |s_1-s_2|+1}^{\min(s_1+s_2,2q-s_1-s_2)-1} \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}} \ , 
 \label{rfrf}
\end{align}
where we anticipate that we only obtain fully degenerate representation. To show this, it is enough to realize that a Kac table representation is fully degenerate if and only if its fusion with a generic Verma module $\mathcal{V}_P$ is zero. From Eq. \eqref{rrsvp}, 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P \subset \sum_{i=-\frac{r-1}{2}}^{\frac{r-1}{2}} \sum_{j=-\frac{s-1}{2}}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} \mathcal{V}_{P+i\beta +j\beta^{-1}} \cap \sum_{i'=-\frac{p-r-1}{2}}^{\frac{p-r-1}{2}} \sum_{j'=-\frac{q-s-1}{2}}^{\frac{q-s-1}{2}} \mathcal{V}_{P+i'\beta +j'\beta^{-1}}\ .
\end{align}
The modules $\mathcal{V}_{P+i\beta +j\beta^{-1}}$ and $\mathcal{V}_{P+i'\beta +j'\beta^{-1}}$ coincide if and only if their momentums are opposite or equal. If they are opposite, $P=-P_{(i+i',j+j')}$ must belong to the (reflected) Kac table, so it is not generic. If they are equal, we have $i\beta +j\beta^{-1} = i'\beta +j'\beta^{-1}$ i.e. $2(i-i')q = 2(j'-j)p$. 
But parity forbids $(i,j)=(i',j')$, since $p$ or $q$ is odd. And we have $2|i-i'|<p$ and $2|j-j'|<q$, so our equality cannot be satisfied, and 
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}\times \mathcal{V}_P = 0 \ . 
\end{align}
Therefore, by associativity of the fusion product, the product of two fully degenerate representations is again a combination of fully degenerate representations.

We therefore define the A-series minimal model AMM$_{p,q}$ by its spectrum, made of fully degenerate fields in the Kac table:
\begin{align}
 \boxed{\mathcal{S}^{\text{AMM}_{p,q}} = \frac12\left\{ V^f_{\langle r,s\rangle} \right\}_{(r,s)\in [1, p-1] \times [1, q-1]} \quad \text{with} \quad 2\leq p<q\ \text{ coprime}}\ .
\end{align}
The factor $\frac12$ accounts for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry \eqref{prqs}. We assume $p<q$ because AMM$_{p, q}=$AMM$_{q,p}$, and $2\leq p$ for the Kac table to be non-empty.


\subsubsection{Runkel--Watts-type CFTs}\label{sec:rwt}

Let us consider a limit of A-series minimal models where $\frac{q}{p}\to \beta_0^2>0$. We first take the Kac table indices to be fixed. 
The Kac table becomes infinite, which suggests 
\begin{align}
 \lim_{\substack{\frac{q}{p}\to \beta_0^2\\ r,s\text{ fixed}}} \text{AMM}_{p,q} = \text{GMM}\ . 
 \label{mm-gmm}
\end{align}
Since we obtain arbitrary degenerate fields $V^d_{\langle r,s\rangle}$ in the limit, it is also possible to send the indices $r,s$ to infinity, and therefore to send the momentums $P_{(r,s)}$ to arbitrary values $P\in\mathbb{R}$, just as in Eq. \eqref{vplim}. Therefore, Liouville theory with $c\leq 1$ is not only a limit of generalized minimal models, but also a limit of minimal models:
\begin{align}
 \lim_{\substack{\frac{q}{p}\to \beta_0^2\\ P_{(r,s)}\to P}} \text{AMM}_{p,q} = \text{Liouville}\ . 
 \label{mm-liou}
\end{align}
However, if $\beta_0^2\in\mathbb{Q}$, it is also possible to fine-tune the behaviour of $p,q,r,s$ such that constraints from the minimal model's fusion rules survive in the limit. As a result, we can obtain not only Liouville theory with its trivial OPE \eqref{idpv}, but also another diagonal CFT with the same continuous spectrum but a non-trivial OPE, called a \textbf{Runkel--Watts-type theory} after the original example at $c=1$, discovered by Runkel and Watts \cite{rw01}. 

To begin with, we write $\beta_0^2 = \frac{q_0}{p_0}$ with $p_0$ and $q_0$ coprime integers, equivalently $\mathbb{Z}\beta_0+\mathbb{Z}\beta_0^{-1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{p_0q_0}}\mathbb{Z}$. There exist infinitely many pairs $(p,q)\in \mathbb{N}^2$ such that 
\begin{align}
 qp_0-pq_0 = 1 \ .
\end{align}
Choosing such pairs amounts to fine-tuning the values of $p, q$, because there are many other ways to satisfy $\lim_{p,q\to\infty}\frac{q}{p}= \frac{q_0}{p_0}$, which is equivalent to $qp_0-pq_0 \ll p$. For fixed $r,s$, we compute the momentum
\begin{align}
 P_{(r,s)} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{p_0q_0}}\left[rq_0-sp_0+ \frac12\left(\frac{r}{p}+\frac{s}{q}\right) + O\left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right)\right]\ . 
 \label{prsrwt}
\end{align}
We now fine-tune $r,s$ such that 
\begin{align}
 \lim(rq_0-sp_0), \lim\frac{r}{p} , \lim\frac{s}{q} <\infty \quad , \quad \lim\frac{r}{p} = \lim\frac{s}{q} \ . 
\end{align}
To achieve this fine-tuning, it is enough to set
\begin{align}
 \left\{\begin{array}{l} r = r_0 + k p_0\ , \\ s = s_0 + k q_0\ , \end{array}\right. \quad  \text{with} \quad k = O(p)\in \mathbb{N}\ .
\end{align}
This leads to 
\begin{align}
 \lim P_{(r,s)} \underset{p,q\to\infty}{=}  \frac{1}{2\sqrt{p_0q_0}}\left(n+x\right)\quad \text{with} \quad \left\{\begin{array}{l} n =r_0q_0 - s_0p_0 \in \mathbb{Z} \ , \\ x =  \lim\frac{r}{p} = \lim\frac{s}{q} \in (0, 1) \ . \end{array}\right.
\end{align}
Now what happens to the minimal model fusion rules $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_1,s_1\rangle} \times \mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r_2,s_2\rangle}$ \eqref{rfrf} when we apply our limit to both representations? Let us examine the momentums \eqref{prsrwt} of the resulting representations $\mathcal{R}^f_{\langle r,s\rangle}$. The combination $n=rq_0-sp_0$ takes integer values such that $n\equiv n_1+n_2+p_0+q_0\bmod 2$, while 
both $\frac{r}{p}$ and $\frac{s}{q}$, and therefore also $x=\frac12\left(\frac{r}{p}+\frac{s}{q}\right)$, are evenly distributed in the interval $(|x_1-x_2|, \min(x_1+x_2,2-x_1-x_2))$. Writing the primary fields as $V_{n,x} = \lim V_{(r,s)}^f$, we thus find the OPE
\begin{align}
 \boxed{V_{n_1,x_1}V_{n_2,x_2} \sim \sum_{n\in n_1+n_2+p_0+q_0+2\mathbb{Z}}
\int_{|x_1-x_2|}^{\min (x_1+x_2,2-x_1-x_2)} dx\ V_{n, x}}\ .
\end{align}
Of course, $V_{n,x}$ is just another notation for the diagonal field $V_P$, with $n,x$ the integer and fractional parts of $2\sqrt{p_0q_0}P$. The reflection relation $V_P=V_{-P}$ is now $V_{n,x}=V_{-n-1,1-x}$. 
The resulting Runkel--Watts-type CFT has the same spectrum as Liouville theory \eqref{sliou} $
 \mathcal{S}^{\text{RWT}_{p_0,q_0}} = \frac12 \left\{ V_P\right\}_{P\in \mathbb{R}}$. In contrast to Liouville theory, the momentums cannot be continued to complex values, where the OPE would no longer make sense. Notice however that if $x_1\neq x_2$, the OPE does not produce fields with degenerate momentums, i.e. fields of the type $V_{n,0}$. So there is no need to regularize the integral over $x$. Alternatively, the OPE may be written in a manifestly reflection-invariant way using the momentums $P_i$ \cite{rs15},
 \begin{align}
  \left<\prod_{i=1}^3 V_{P_i}\right>\neq 0 \implies \prod_{\pm,\pm} \sin\pi\left(\tfrac{p_0+q_0}{2}+\sqrt{p_0q_0}(P_1\pm P_2\pm P_3)\right) < 0 \ .
  \label{rwtz}
 \end{align}
It turns out that Runkel--Watts-type theories can also be obtained as limits of Liouville theory with $\beta^2\in \mathbb{C}-\mathbb{R}$ \cite{mce07}. The limit of Liouville theory for $\beta^2\to \beta_0^2>0$ generally does not make sense, but it exists if $\beta_0^2$ is rational and the momentums are real. In this limit, the condition \eqref{rwtz} emerges from the three-point structure constants of Liouville theory. 


\subsection{Non-diagonal CFTs with 2 degenerate fields}

\subsubsection{D-series minimal models}

Conservation of diagonality from \eqref{sriz}.

\subsubsection{E-series minimal models}

Give spectrum. In which sense do we have 2 degenerate fields? 

Postpone fusion rules: search for simple derivation. Or accept that some vanishings are features of structure constants: need to study 3pt structure constants too! 

\subsubsection{Non-rational CFTs}

\subsection{Loop models}

As their name indicates, critical loop models were originally defined as critical limits of statistical models that describe non-intersecting loops in our two-dimensional space. Starting with the Ising models, many statistical models can be reformulated in terms of loops, and more models can be directly constructed from loops. But there is a lot of choice about which observables to include in the model. In the Ising model, if we consider only local observables, we obtain a minimal model in the critical limit. If we also consider non-local observables such as cluster connectivities, we obtain a much richer CFT. Deciding which fields to include in the spectrum is therefore not easy, but also not very important, as long as we can extend the spectrum when needed. 

Here, we will define an extended spectrum that contains all the fields that are known to appear in loop models, and that have half-integer spins. Three known models give rise to integer-spin subsets of this spectrum: the $O(n)$ model, the $U(n)$ model and the Potts model. Each one of these models has
\begin{itemize}
 \item a modular-invariant torus partition function,
 \item a group of global symmetries that commutes with conformal symmetry. 
\end{itemize}

not worry too much about spectrum of CFT, but about spectrum of correl fct. 

deg field implies unbounded $s$. We also want $s$ very small to not have minimal model or suchlike. This implies unbounded $r$. 

What if $V_{(r,s)}$ is spinless i.e. $rs=0$? The field $V_{(r,0)}$ is in fact non-diagonal, because its OPE with $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$ yields fields $V_{(r,\pm 1)}$ that have nonzero spins. On the other hand, $V_{(0,s)}$ is in fact an alternative notation for a diagonal field,
\begin{align}
 V_{(0,s)} = V_{\frac12 s\beta^{-1}}  \quad \iff \quad V_P = V_{(0, 2\beta P)}\ . 
 \label{vosvp}
\end{align}
For clarity, we will mostly write $V_P$ for diagonal fields. However, results that are derived for $V_{(r,s)}$ also apply to diagonal fields, starting with Eq. \eqref{sriz}.

Loop CFT: all non-diag fields, all diag fields. 

$O(n)$: take all non-diag fields, add as many deg. fields as possible. $V^d_{\langle 1,3\rangle}V_{(r,s)}=V_{(r,s-2)}+V_{(r,s)}+V_{(r,s+2)}$

$U(n)$:  assume $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}$, this restricts non-diag fields.

Potts: Add one diag. field in addition, remove some non-diag.

In the case of diagonal CFTs with 2 degenerate fields, we have used limits for defining Liouville theory with $c\leq 1$ as well as Runkel--Watts-type theories. Let us summarize these limits, together with other limits that were discussed 
in Section \ref{sec:diag}, and also other limits that relate Liouville theory, (generalized) minimal models, and Runkel--Watts-type theories: 
\begin{align}

\draw [ultra thick, shorten <= 2mm, shorten >= 2mm, -latex, dashed,
       out = 170, in = 10] (gmm1) to (mm);

\draw [ultra thick, shorten <= 2mm, shorten >= 2mm, -latex, dashed] (liou) to (gmm2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\label{lims}
\end{align}
Somewhat subjectively, we have distinguished limits that are straightforward (full arrows) from limits that are subtle (dashed arrows). The subtle limits are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\boxed{\text{AMM}\to \text{RWT}}$ (Section \ref{sec:rwt}): This involves fine-tuning the parameters $p,q$ of the minimal models, as well as the parameters $r,s$ of the primary fields.
  \item $\boxed{\text{Liouville}\to \text{RWT}}$ (Section \ref{sec:rwt}): This requires a detailed analysis of structure constants. 
 \item $\boxed{\text{GMM}\to \text{AMM}}$ (\cite{rib18}): This requires a detailed analysis of correlation functions, and only some of the GMM correlation functions tend to AMM correlation functions. 
 \item $\boxed{\text{Liouville}\to \text{GMM}}$ (Section \ref{sec:essc}): This requires a detailed analysis of correlation functions.
\end{itemize}



Summary table of CFTs, spectrums, features. Main features for classifying: diagonal? deg. fields? influence of deg. fields on spectrum or structure constants? degree of diagonality: values of $r$ for non-diagonal fields? Denominators for $s$? 

Other CFTs: here or intro? 

Log-MM: not well-understood. Presumably, limit of GMM. 

Ashkin--Teller, free boson: not clear how many degenerate fields. Fusion of deg. field $V^d_{\langle 1, 3\rangle}$: only one field appears, violating assumption, and violating $r\in\frac12\mathbb{Z}$. Better understood from affine symmetry. Cannot derive spectrum from Virasoro symmetry. 


\section{Degenerate four-point functions}\label{sec:dfpf}

Could be interpreted as using OPE associativity for $V^{deg}VV$ just like we did for $TVV$ and getting constraints on interchiral descendants. 

\subsection{BPZ equations and their solutions}

Non-diagonal, simplify it as much as possible. Non-diagonal solution. 

Loop weights are invariant under shifts, left undetermined. 

$s\to s+1$ shift equations can be violated, cf Potts model. $s\to s+2$ may be derived from $(1,2)$ deg. field but are always obeyed if $(1,3)$ exists. 

Do not try to rederive monodromies of BPZ equations! 

\subsection{Exact solutions for structure constants}\label{sec:essc}

Deduce analytic properties of correlation functions, and limits of CFTs. 

Do we want a synthetic table of known solutions? 

\begin{itemize}
\item Invariance of $C_{(r_1,s_1)(r_2,s_2)(r_3,s_3)}$ under permutations of $1,2,3$
\item Reduction to $C_{P_1,P_2,P_3}$ if $\forall i, r_i=0$ 
 \item $V_{\langle 1,2\rangle}^d$ shift equations $\implies$ $s_i\to s_i+2$  
 \item Parity $\forall i, (r_i,s_i)\to (r_i,-s_i)$, reflection $(r_i,s_i)\to (-r_i,-s_i)$
\end{itemize}


See whether in Liouville theory fields with deg. dimensions are actually deg. For $c\leq 1$, guess not deg. from AMM limit. For other $c$, need to know about poles of struct. csts. So answer is probably no. Postpone the problem to analysis of correl. 

\subsection{Remarks}

Compute vanishings of ratios of structure constants in $V^d_{\langle 2,1\rangle}V_P$. 

For $P=P_{(0,n)}$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we find only $V_{P_{(-1,n)}}$ i.e. the coef of $V_{P_{(1,n)}}$ vanishes. For $n>0$, this is a consequence of Virasoro symmetry i.e. appearance of NV whose fusion rules would be violated. For $n=0$ this does not follow from Virasoro symmetry: interpret as interchiral phenomenon?

For $P=P_{(1,n)}$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we find only $V_{P_{(2,n)}}$ i.e. the coef of $V_{P_{(0,n)}}$ vanishes. Now, Virasoro symmetry is not responsible. In fact it would be perfectly consistent to have $V_{P_{(0,n)}}$ alone, the OPE coefs are not divergent. The problem is purely interchiral: it is about the ratio of coefs in an interchiral module, not in a Virasoro module. 

\section{Numerical bootstrap}

Synthesis of what precedes?

Notion of interchiral symmetry. Liouville 4pt is only one interchiral block? Same for MM, including non-diagonal. Distinguish double interchiral from simple interchiral, cf nb of deg. fields. 

Sketch method. Start with Zamolodchikov recursion.

\subsection{Virasoro conformal blocks and Zamolodchikov's recursion}

\subsection{Interchiral blocks} \label{sec:icb}


\section{Logarithmic representations and fields} \label{sec:log}

Reread my results on limits of 4pt functions, try to infer general rules on appearance of logarithms, depending on fusion rules?

Logarithmic fields?

Criterion for $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}$ limit to become logarithmic? For 4pt function, criterion about vanishing of residues, which depends on fusion rules being obeyed for NV? In MM case we completely escape log. reps, criterion should account for that.  
For $c>25$, what happens to GMM at rational $b^2$? Concidences of dimensions boil down to $\Delta_{(r,s)}-\Delta_{(r,-s)} \in \mathbb{Z}$ modulo $(p, -q)$. 

We need log reps. Can deduce them from non-log using degenerate fields. Issue is conceptually less important if we adopt interchiral symmetry, since logarithms only appear for interchiral descendants. 

To get log reps we need associativity of OPE of degenerate field. We might say that this does not belong to the chiral, algebraic part of the review. However, to get conformal blocks we need associativity of OPEs of the energy-momentum tensor. Again, interchiral point of view changes things! And we need bootstrap axioms, including single-valuedness? 

Emergence of logarithms: $\Delta_{P+\frac{\beta}{2}}-\Delta_{P-\frac{\beta}{2}} = \beta P$ integer $\implies P=P_{(0,s)}$. This calculation is a diagonal version of the argument about integer spin that leads to non-diagonal $O(n)$ space of states.

In $V^d_{\langle 1,2\rangle}V^N_{(r,0)} = \sum_\pm V^N_{(r,\pm 1)}$ it is not just spins but also dimensions that differ by integers. 

Need we assume that $V^N_{(r,0)}$ is the limit of diagonal fields? Why would we not get $V_{P_{(r,0)}}$? Are there two ways to take the limit? See OPE coefficients.
